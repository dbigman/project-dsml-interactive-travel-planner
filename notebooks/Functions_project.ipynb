The building dates from 1896 or 1897. It was designed by the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers. The architecture consists of 19th Neoclassical architecture style. The building is of architectural significance since it is the only one-story building of this style remaining in the city of Ponce and one of the best examples on the Island. Completed in 1897, the year before the Spanish–American War of 1898, this building was the last major construction undergone by the Spanish Government in the Americas. From 1905 to the mid-1970s, the structure served as the Asilo de Ciegos de Ponce (Ponce Blind Asylum). As of 2020, the building sits abandoned.\", \"The structure commonly known as the Asilo de Ciegos (Home of the Blind) was built between 1896 and 1897 to serve as a hospital for the city of Ponce's military garrison. The Royal Spanish Engineering Corps constructed this building in the then-popular neoclassic style, which was common to the old San Juan area but was not at the time prevalent in Ponce. This building, together with El Castillo (Ponce's Spanish military headquarters), Hospital Tricoche (Ponce's Municipal Hospital), and the Casa Alcaldía are the only remaining buildings representative of the Spanish Crown's interest in other areas of the Island besides San Juan.\"]\n",

It was being used as a district jailhouse in 1987. In the late 1980s, it ceased to be used as a district jail, was reconditioned, and in 1992 it was inaugurated as the headquarters of the Ponce School of Fine Arts, which is its current role.\n",

Originally built as a social club for Ponce\\'s elite, it is currently used as the premier reception center of \"The Noble City of Puerto Rico.\" The building, designed by Agustin Camilo Gonzalez in the Second Empire and Neo-Rococo styles, has a French facade and tones. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 28 October 1987. It is located at the corner of Marina and Luna streets. The building has been called \"an icon of Ponce\\'s architecture, history, and identity.\" It is owned and administered by the Ponce Municipal Government. In 1936, during the Great Depression, the Casino declared bankruptcy and shut down. It subsequently had various uses: a postal office, a public health unit, tax collector\\'s office, and even a temporary city hall. In 1990, it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government, and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His Majesty Felipe de Borbón, took place.\\n\\nPonce had three casinos before this one. The first Casino de Ponce was founded in 1862, on Calle Marina. It met at the location that was later (in 1911) used by Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón as his law office. The organization stopped meeting due to political quarrels between the two political factions in its membership representing groups for and against the government of Spanish General Sanz, but it reformed on 19 July 1876. This second Casino de Ponce was located on the second floor of the property owned by Don Carlos Cabrera Martinez, one of the distinguished members of the Ponce high society. Their meeting location was on an elegant structure at the northeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Cristina, facing Plaza Las Delicias. The third Casino de Ponce reformed on 29 June 1897. It met next to Teatro La Perla, on the east side of Calle Mayor, between Calle Isabel and Calle Cristina, immediately north of the theater. It moved 25 years later, in 1922, to the pompous locale at the southeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Luna, that is the subject of', 'municipality': 'Unknown', 'name': 'Antiguo Casino de Ponce', 'source_file': 'antiguo_casino_de_ponce.txt'}, {'category': 'Landmark', 'coordinates': \"{'latitude': -66.6207194444, 'longitude': 18.0215}\", 'description': 'The Hotel Ponce Intercontinental (also known as \"El Ponce\") is an abandoned hotel with a still existing structure at Cerro del Vigía in Ponce, Puerto Rico.
