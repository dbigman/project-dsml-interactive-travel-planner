        "description": "\\n TheAntiguo Casino de Ponce(English: Old Ponce Casino), or simply theCasino de Ponce, is a historic structure, built in 1922 and located inBarrio Cuarto,Ponce, Puerto Rico. Originally built as a social club for Ponce\\'s elite, it is currently used as the premierreception centerof\"The Noble City of Puerto Rico\".[3]The building, designed byAgustin Camilo Gonzalezin theSecond EmpireandNeo-Rococostyles, has a French facade and tones.[4]It was listed in theNational Register of Historic Placeson 28 October 1987. It is located at the corner of Marina and Luna streets. The building has been called \"an icon of Ponce\\'s architecture, history, and identity.\"[5]It is owned and administered by the Ponce Municipal Government.[6]In 1936, during theGreat Depression, the Casino declared bankruptcy and shut down.[7]It subsequently had various uses: a postal office, a public health unit, tax collector\\'s office, and even a temporary city hall. In 1990 it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government,[2]and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His MajestyFelipe de Borbon, took place.[2]\\n Ponce had three casinos before this one. The first Casino de Ponce was founded in 1862, on Calle Marina. It met at the location that was later (in 1911) used byRosendo Matienzo Cintronas his law office.[8]The organization stopped meeting due to political quarrels between the two political factions in its membership representing groups for and against the government of Spanish General Sanz, but it reformed on 19 July 1876.[8]This second Casino de Ponce was located on the second floor of the property owned by Don Carlos Cabrera Martinez, one of the distinguished members of the Ponce high society. Their meeting location was on an elegant structure at the northeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Cristina, facingPlaza Las Delicias. The third Casino de Ponce reformed on 29 June 1897.[8]It met next toTeatro La Perla, on the east side of Calle Mayor, between Calle Isabel and Calle Cristina, immediately north of the theater.[9]It moved 25 years later, in 1922, to the pompous locale at the southeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Luna, that is the subject of this article.\\n",

The land has been offered to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico but because of financial troubles the purchase never concluded. The land remains under private ownership but part of the Bay is Federal Land. Bah\\xc3\\xada de Jobos was established as a National Estuarine Sanctuary in 1981. Jobos Bay private lands remains the only undeveloped bay lands in the entire island, consisting of close to 160 hectares (400 acres) and more than 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of frontage to the bay. In fact, The Jobos Bay property controls most of the northern section of the Bay. It runs close to Aguirre Sugar Mill and all the way to the Eastern edge of Jobos Bay. This property can be developed for commercial and private use.[3]A new corporation was established in 2017 Jobos Bay Properties, Inc. to administer the sale of the land in private hands.[4]\\n Since the 1980s, land-use in the areas surrounding Bah\\xc3\\xada de Jobos has continued to change. The Corporacion Amoros private reserve borders theAguirre State Foreston the East, a fisherman village (Las Mareas) on the West, and agricultural and residential land on the north. Due to urbanization in the region and shifting irrigation regimes, watershed dynamics have changed significantly.[citation needed]\\n",

Carnegie\\'s private secretary,James Bertram, indicated that the amount usually donated was 10 times the promised maintenance expenses. Nevertheless, Brumbaugh obtained the $100,000 amount.[4]This was in part due to then-GovernorArthur Yager\\'sfriendship with Carnegie himself.[6]Its origins stem from the Insular Library created in 1903, created by thethen-new civil government, which itself came from themilitary-rule eraSan Juan Free Library, which was a merger of five pre-existing libraries under Spanish-rule: the library of theDominicanand Franciscan monasteries, theReal Sociedad Econ\\xc3\\xb3mica de Amigos del Pa\\xc3\\xads, the library of theProvincial Council[es]andTreasury Department of Puerto Rico, the library of theRoyal College of Lawyers-General Secretaryand the library of theInstitute of Secondary Educationand Normal School.[2][7]\\n It has aClassical Revivalstylings and was designed and built by the Puerto Rican engineer Ram\\xc3\\xb3n Carbia in 1914, when work on the project commenced on land donated by the Puerto Rico government.[2][4]In June 1916, the collection of the Insular Library, which had previously been known as the San Juan Public Library,[5]was transferred to the building and the library, which was named Biblioteca Carnegie, itself was inaugurated on 27 July,[4]when the Puerto Rican government formally accepted the donation.[2]From 1917 till 2010, the library was administered by theDepartment of Education.[5]In its first forty years of service the library had nine reading rooms, membership, with an average of 200 daily visitors.[2][4]Under the 222 Law of 1946 a $6,000 amount was made available to the library\\'s board of trustees, with the intent of establishing theBiblioteca Rodante(\"Library on Wheels\"). The then-Department of Public Instructionwas authorized to organize and equip the Biblioteca Rodante, which offered it services through the use ofcajas viajeras(\"travelling boxes\"), which were shelves used to carry books to isolated schools and communities.[4]The project started in 1948 under the direction of Federico Porrata Dor\\xc3\\xada,Francisco Porrata-Dor\\xc3\\xada\\'sbrother, with two vehicles carrying books for children and adults, as users ranged from elementary-level school children to adults aged eighty to ninety-years old.[2]\\n",

Larger waves can sort out sand grains leaving deposits of heavy minerals visible on thesurface of erosionescarpments.\\n Black sands are used by miners and prospectors to indicate the presence of a placer formation.Placer miningactivities produce a concentrate that is composed mostly of black sand. Black sand concentrates often contain additional valuables, other than precious metals:rare earth elements,thorium,titanium,tungsten,zirconiumand others are often fractionated duringigneousprocesses into a common mineral-suite that becomes black sands after weathering and erosion.\\n",

Designed by the well-known architectBlas Silvain 1913, the residence stands out among the great houses of Ponce for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornament. Adapting the curves of the \"Art Nouveau\" to the persistentNeo-classicismof Puerto Rico and the recently bornCreolevocabulary of Ponce, Silva succeeded in creating a movement in architecture which broke away from the traditional forms while remaining within them. The traditional continuous raisedverandahalong the front facade is broken up into two and twisted out of its usual linearity into the curved forms preserved today. Characteristic of the architecture to abound in Ponce contemporaneous to Castillo 34 is a profusion of appliqu\\xc3\\xa9, andeclecticcombination and juxtaposition of shapes, particularly curvilinear, and a general ostentation of articulation. Blas Silva was probably the most established of the \"wedding-cake architects\" and was thus sought after mostly by the \"nouveau riche\" of the period. Silva\\'s houses are among the richest in Ponce, among which the Monsanto Residence stands put for its circular porches.

The house sits in thePonce Historic Zone. The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of theClassical Revivalstyle in used in Ponce designs in the early part of the 20th century and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built byAlfredo B. Wiechers, so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce.[2]\\n The Wiechers-Villaronga Residence was built in 1912 by Alfredo B. Wiechers, architect, for his own residence and studio, which he sold later to Mr. Julio Mercado, who in turn give it to his daughter, Elena Mercado and her husband Mr. Gabriel Villaronga as a wedding present. Wiechers was born in Ponce and studied at theSchool of Architecturein Paris, France, in 1901, where he was bestowed agold medalfor outstanding achievement and excellence during his professional studies. He graduated in 1905 and worked at the office ofEnric Sagnier, a famous Spanish architect, inBarcelona, Spain. In 1911, he decided to work and live in Ponce; thus he designed and built his house and studio which he opened in 1912. In a short period of time, from 1911 to 1918, Wiechers was commissioned with various important buildings such as: the Loggia Aurora, Club Deportivo de Damas, the Havana Theatre,Banco of Ponce Building, andSanto Asilo de Damas Hospitalamong others, where he fully expressed the EuropeanNeo-Classicalstyle which he learned from, and was influenced by, Enric Sagnier.[2]\\n The Neo-Classical influence is manifested in most of his buildings and particularly in the Villaronga residence for its richness and highly decorative details (pilasters, rusticatedpodium,cornices, \"candelabra\",reliefandmotifs,Ioniccapitols, etc. are some of the decorative details of the Neo-Classical trend). The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of this style and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built by Wiechers, so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce.[2]\\n",

The main structure is made of thick concrete masonry walls with wooden beams that support a flat brick roof. The wooden window designs became a typeface and inspiration for other private residences that were built afterwards in Yauco and beyond. The house is notable for the integration of various types of traditional construction techniques of time while also importing new techniques foreign in Puerto Rico at the time such as the use of forged cast iron in both the structural and ornamentation systems of the building. The cast iron was built and imported from theSaint-Louis FoundryinParis. The architectural style of the building is eclectic and foreign in the island at the time of its construction, bringing inspiration from theFrench Creoledesigns which were famous inNew Orleansat the time.[3]\\n The Cesari manor house is the largest urban property in downtown Yauco and is widely seen as an architectural landmark of the Corsican community of Yauco and Puerto Rico. The house was one of the earliest in Puerto Rico to be designed with a cast-iron girder and brick roof style. Its designer was architect Antonio Mattei Lluberas, after whom the house is often named, a rich landowner ofCorsicanandCatalandescent who studied architecture in Paris. He later became famous for his opposition to the Spanish control of Puerto Rico and became an independence revolutionary leader in the failed1896and1897revolts inGuayanillaand Yauco, respectively. The 1897 revolt in Yauco became notable for being the first time when theflag of Puerto Ricowas raised in the island.[4]Mattei Lluberas became exiled after these attempts and returned to become mayor of Yauco during theSpanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War. He did not live in the house he designed, which instead became the property of another Corsican businessman - \\xc3\\x81ngel C\\xc3\\xa9sari Poggi and his wife,Angela Antongiorgi Rodr\\xc3\\xadguez. This Corsican-Puerto Rican family owned many acres of lands and properties throughout Yauco and southern Puerto Rico which they developed as sugarcane plantations, processing plants and refineries (centrales).[3]\\n",

The other version has Salcedo being offered a ride across a river by Ta\\xc3\\xadnos who carried him on their arms, and then drowned him and kept him for days, afraid he\\'d still be alive and waiting until they were certain he was dead.[3]\\n A third, and most accepted version of Salcedo\\'s death says that the Tainos, fearing that the Spaniards might be gods, refrained from harming them. After suffering under the Spaniards for so long, the Tainos, by order of Ag\\xc3\\xbceyban\\xc3\\xa1, ambushed Salcedo as he was drinking water at the edge of a river. Fearing that Salcedo might resurrect after three days—based on their understanding of the Christian teachings wielded by Catholic priests—they sat around for three days waiting for Salcedo to come back from the dead, but all they saw was Salcedo\\'s body rotting due to the heat just as they would. At that moment the Tainos realized that these were no gods.[4]\\n",

Other rivers found within the forest boundaries are theCialitos,SalienteandToro Negrorivers. The forest is particularly vital for the hydrological preservation of the Toro Negro River. The most notable geographical feature of the forest reserve is theTres Picachosmountain which rises to an elevation of 3,176 feet (968 m) above sea level.

Hildebrandof the Departments ofAgricultureandCommerce.[3]The original district consisted of six buildings and additional infrastructure built using stone and concrete as construction materials. The hatchery facilities officially opened in January 1938, and it represents the introduction of recreation fishing or sport fishing in Puerto Rico.[2]\\n TheGovernment of Puerto Ricoadded an additional 2.75 acres for the hatchery in 1940, and by 1942, the expanded fish hatchery facilities included large grow-out ponds for breeding fish (particularlybrownandrainbow trout) and sixteen smaller ponds for breeding ofcrustaceans. At a later date, another grow-out pond was added in the northern segment, west of the original ponds. Reconstruction of these facilities were undertaken between the years 1998 and 2000 after considerable damages caused byHurricane Georges, which devastated the island in September 1998.[4]At a later date, a visitor parking was built on a lot across the Maricao River.

The forest is located east of theUniversity of Puerto Rico Botanical Gardenin theSabana Llana Surdistrict ofSan Juan,[1]making it one of the two state forests located within the capital\\'s municipal boundaries (the other beingSan Patricio State Forest).[2]\\n The area where the forest now stands had originally been deforested and was the site of several quarries. The forest reserve was first proclaimed in 1998 with the intention of preserving one of the last green areas inSan Juanas asecondary forest. The city is very densely populated and has lost most of its forests due tourban sprawl. This was done thanks to the effort of local residents, academics and environmentalists. In 2003 the forest was added to theSan Juan Ecological Corridormanagement zone, also managed by the municipality of San Juan which designates the area as ecologically important as it forms part of the hydrological basin of theestuaryofSan Juan Bay.[2]Between the years 1998 and 2005 the forest was used for research purposes for studying the impact ofHurricane Georgesin the destruction and regrowth of the forest.[3]\\n The forest is very characteristic of thesecondary forestecosystem found throughout Puerto Rico. Some native tree species found in the forest are the yarumo (Cecropia schreberiana), the West Indian locust tree (Hymenaea courbaril), the Puerto Rican royal palm tree (Roystonea borinquena), and the pink trumpet tree (Tabebuia heterophylla) or Puerto Rican oak as it is colloquially known. Common introduced trees found in the forest are the flea tree (Albizia lebbeck), the karoi tree (Albizia procera) and the Malay pterocarpus (Pterocarpus indicus).[2]\\n",

It is located between the municipalities ofCamuy,Hatillo, andLaresin northwesternPuerto Rico, but the main entrance to the park is located in Quebrada, Camuy.[1][2]The caverns are part of a large network of natural limestone caves and underground waterways carved out by the third-largest underground river in the world, the R\\xc3\\xado Camuy (Camuy River).[5][6]The cave system was \"discovered\" in 1958 and was first documented in the 1973 bookDiscovery at the R\\xc3\\xado Camuy(ISBN0-517-50594-0) by Russell and Jeanne Gurnee, but there is archaeological evidence that these caves were explored hundreds of years ago by theTa\\xc3\\xadnoIndians, Puerto Rico\\'s first inhabitants.[7][8]Over 10 miles of caverns, 220 caves and 17 entrances[9]to the Camuy cave system have been mapped so far. This, however, is only a fraction of the entire system which many experts believe still holds another 800 caves. \\nOnly a small part of the complex is open to the public. The 268-acre park built around the cave system features tours of some of the caves and sinkholes, and is one of the most popular natural attractions in Puerto Rico. After restorations necessitated byHurricane Maria, a destructive storm that struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the park re-opened on March 24, 2021. It then closed again from September 2022 until February 2023 due toHurricane Fiona.[10]\\n \"Cueva Clara de Empalme\" or Clara Cave is the main attraction at the Rio Camuy Cave Park. A single chamber of this cave system has been developed for the public, starting in 1986. Regular cavern guided tour and audio tours are available at the site. Since November 2010, night tours called ECO NIGHTS have been organized weekly under special reservations. The tours start with the screening a short movie in a 90-seat theater, explaining the Rio Camuy Cave System and site safety rules, followed by a train ride that takes visitors into the entrance of Clara Cave. The huge chamber is 700 ft (212m) in length and 215 ft (65m) high.[11]Once inside this chamber, visitors are able to see an entrance from the roof of \"Sumidero de Empalme\" that is 60m from the surface, as well as stalactites, stalagmites, unique formations and thousands of bats.\\n",

The river flow of the Usab\\xc3\\xb3n is fed by numerous tributaries, particularly the Aibonito and Barranquitas Rivers, which flow from the south and north of the canyon, respectively. These rivers are named after the municipalities they originate from, to which the Usab\\xc3\\xb3n functions as a natural municipal boundary. This river system, along with its wider hydrological basin of La Plata, have sculpted the canyonlands of the eastern Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. This process has created numerous waterfalls, some of which are the tallest in Puerto Rico. For example, La Vaca Falls (Salto La Vaca), at approximately 300 feet (91.4 m), is the tallest waterfall in the island.[4]This canyon system is much bigger than the San Crist\\xc3\\xb3bal and Las Bocas Canyons, and it includes other gorges and steep river valleys such as those of La Plata inComer\\xc3\\xadoandArroyatainCidra. This canyon is notable for being the deepest canyon in the West Indies with a maximum depth of up to 800 feet (200 m).[3]\\n Before the flow of the Usab\\xc3\\xb3n River, the area where the San Crist\\xc3\\xb3bal Canyon is located was the location of a formerfault lineduring theLate Cretaceousperiod. This fault line might have contributed to the inward flow of previous rivers by creating a depression next to a rise of the superficial terrestrial crust along the region which began the process of carving the gorge approximately 90 million years ago. This hydrological process caused the movement of sediments which today are evident in the rich diversity of soil types that are found in the area.[3]\\n",

This is asecondary or second-growth forestis located in theGobernador Pi\\xc3\\xb1erodistrict ofSan Juan, between the neighborhoods of Villa Borinquen, Caparra Heights and Borinquen Towers complex. The urban forest has entrances onRoosevelt Avenueand Ensenada Street. The forest extends to almost 70 acres and it is the smallest protected area in the Puerto Rico state forest system. One of the most distinctive features of the forest is themogoteon its northern edge which can be observed from many parts of San Juan andGuaynabo.[1]The forest is part of theNorthern Karst.\\n The site of the forest was first developed foragricultureandcattle grazingand used to be a farm calledFinca San Patricio. There used to be three mogotes on the site but two were destroyed to make way for the construction of the Villa Borinquen neighborhood and the Borinquen Towers complex. The third mogote still exists and it hosts a communications tower. The rest of the land was originally acquired by the US Army with the intention of developing residences for nearbyFort Buchanan.[1]In 1962 the city of San Juan was experiencing a population boom and urban sprawl destroyed much of the original forest areas of the region. The area where the forest is located was not spared as if it was cleared to make way for more neighborhoods, and the only part of the forest to remain relatively untouched was that around the only remaining mogote. In 1960, the army left and abandoned the residences there and from 1974 to 1999 most of those residences were demolished.[2]At the time the land was owned by the governmental Corporation for Housing and Urban Development (Spanish:Corporaci\\xc3\\xb3n de Renovaci\\xc3\\xb3n Urbana y Vivienda) or CRUV (today known as thePuerto Rico Department of Housing) and the land was intended to be developed to build housing of social interest but these were never built and the modern forest started to grow in the abandoned land. The area was considered one of the last green zones in San Juan and as such in 1998 the environmentalist groupCiudadanos Pro Bosque San Patricio,[3]along with scientists and local residents, pushed to have the land be proclaimed a forest preserve. On August 3, 2000, the forest is proclaimed through an executive order and granted to thePuerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources(DRNA) to manage and preserve the secondary forest and its ecology. The goal of this proclamation is to preserve the forest for the purpose of recreation and scientific research.[1]After being closed due to the destruction caused byHurricane Mariain 2017, the forest has recently been revitalized and it re-opened in April of 2021.[4]\\n",

It is located atCandelaria Street, (formerlyCalle McKinley)and Dr. Basora Streets, in the city ofMayag\\xc3\\xbcez. The theater building consists of theLucy Boscana Halland theRoberto Cole Cafe Theater.\\n It was originally erected by Francisco Maym\\xc3\\xb3n Palmer in 1909. Maym\\xc3\\xb3n\\'s parents emigrated toPuerto RicofromItalyin the 19th century. They settled in the town of San German. Early in the 20th century Francisco tried to build a theatre in the town of San German but was unable due to the existing religious culture then, which considered a theatre as a \"bad influence\\' on the local population. Maym\\xc3\\xb3n was an entrepreneur by vocation, having travelled to Europe and the United States in his 20s, and he would not be stopped. He moved to the nearby city of Mayaguez where he established himself as one of the pioneers of the industry ofcinematographyin the island of Puerto Rico, introducing this new form of Visual Art early in the beginning of the 20th century by showingsilent filmsthroughout the nearby towns and becoming the exclusive distributor for \\'Nicholas Power Co.\\' movie projectors throughout the Caribbean islands. The \\'Nicholas Power Company\\' was located in New York. With the help of his business partners Mr. Jose Rahola and Mr. Fundador Vargas, he imported movies from the Path\\xc3\\xa9 Company inEurope, showing them in town centers (plazas) under the stars and at the old Mayaguez Municipal Theater (\\'Teatro Municipal\\'). The latter no longer exists, as it was destroyed in the 1918 earthquake that hit the city and was never rebuilt, hence the Teatro Yag\\xc3\\xbcez became the city\\'s preferred gathering place for opera, plays, concerts, and silent movies.\\n Francisco purchased the land where the Yaguez sits today around 1905. The construction of the first Teatro Yag\\xc3\\xbcez building began around 1907; The formal inauguration was in 1909. Materials such as the cement was imported from Germany, interior ceilings from Italy, tiles and carpets from Spain. An architectural jewel, the Teatro Yag\\xc3\\xbcez began as aneo-baroquestyle Opera House, years later turning into a silent movie theater. Incorrectly described as art deco style, however, the art deco movement developed years after the theater\\'s first construction and later reconstruction.\\n",

This period is bracketed on one end by the cession, on December 10, 1898, of the island of Puerto Rico to the United States by Spain as a condition of theTreaty of Parisending theSpanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93American War, and on the other by the completion in 1931 of the major building and rehabilitation program undertaken by theU.S. Customs ServicefollowingWorld War I.[2]\\n While the Fajardo Custom House is the least imposing of the customhouses included in this multiple-resource nomination, it is still more impressive than those at Arecibo, Arroyo and Aguadilla, which were constructed during the same period but are no longer owned by the United States Customs Service. Its amplified Spanish Colonial-Revival style is in keeping with the somber economic import of its construction date, and the building provides a feeling of permanence and dignity in a minimally developed area. It was designed byAlbert B. Nichols, architect and building inspector, Puerto Rico Field Office of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. Ten sheets of drawings of the Fajardo construction signed by Nichols (out of a total of twelve sheets) are in the San Juan Custom House files.[2]\\n Fajardo was in use as a port of entry at the end of the Spanish era and through much of the early American period. A small plain customhouse of the Spanish period is known to have exited here.\\n",

The Sierra palm (Gaussia attenuata), the cock\\'s-spur (Erythtrina eggersii) and palo de rosa (Ottoschulzia rhodoxylon) grow on limestone mogotes; the latter two are highly endangered due to habitat loss.[1][3]\\n",

        "description": "Whale watchingis the practice of observingwhalesanddolphins(cetaceans) in their natural habitat. Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf.birdwatching), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes.[1]A study prepared forInternational Fund for Animal Welfarein 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.[2]The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with thewhalingindustry about the best use of whales as anatural resource.\\n Organized whale watching started in the United States, when theCabrillo National MonumentinSan Diegowas declared a public venue for observing the migration ofgray whales; the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year, 1950.[1]In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters.[1]The industry spread throughout the western coast of the United States over the following decade.[1]\\n In 1971 theMontreal Zoological Societycommenced the first commercial whale watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in theSt. Lawrence Riverto viewfinandbeluga whales.[1]By the mid-1970s, live captures for aquaria had reduced the orca populations in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington, particularly thesouthern resident orcapopulation. According to their scientific chroniclers, in the 1980s commercial whale watching started becoming an alternative means of viewing and appreciating orcas.[3]In 1984,Erich Hoyt, who had spent much time amongst theorcasof British Columbia, published the first comprehensive book on whale watching,The Whale Watcher\\'s Handbook, whichMark Carwardinecalled his number one \"natural classic\" book inBBC Wildlifemagazine.[4]\\n",
