Originally built as a social club for Ponce\\'s elite, it is currently used as the premierreception centerof\"The Noble City of Puerto Rico\".[3]The building, designed byAgustin Camilo Gonzalezin theSecond EmpireandNeo-Rococostyles, has a French facade and tones.[4]It was listed in theNational Register of Historic Placeson 28 October 1987. It is located at the corner of Marina and Luna streets. The building has been called \"an icon of Ponce\\'s architecture, history, and identity.\"[5]It is owned and administered by the Ponce Municipal Government.[6]In 1936, during theGreat Depression, the Casino declared bankruptcy and shut down.[7]It subsequently had various uses: a postal office, a public health unit, tax collector\\'s office, and even a temporary city hall. In 1990 it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government,[2]and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His MajestyFelipe de Borbon, took place.[2]\\n",
            "Ponce had three casinos before this one. The first Casino de Ponce was founded in 1862, on Calle Marina. It met at the location that was later (in 1911) used byRosendo Matienzo Cintronas his law office.[8]The organization stopped meeting due to political quarrels between the two political factions in its membership representing groups for and against the government of Spanish General Sanz, but it reformed on 19 July 1876.[8]This second Casino de Ponce was located on the second floor of the property owned by Don Carlos Cabrera Martinez, one of the distinguished members of the Ponce high society. Their meeting location was on an elegant structure at the northeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Cristina, facingPlaza Las Delicias. The third Casino de Ponce reformed on 29 June 1897.[8]It met next toTeatro La Perla, on the east side of Calle Mayor, between Calle Isabel and Calle Cristina, immediately north of the theater.[9]It moved 25 years later, in 1922, to the pompous locale at the southeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Luna, that is the subject of this article.\\n"

The bay is an intertidal tropical ecosystem dominated byseagrass beds,coral reefs, andmangroves.[2]In an area of 1,140 hectares (2,800 acres), the reserve contains five distinct habitat types and provides sanctuary to several endangered species. Baha de Jobos is one of28 reservesthat comprise theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA)National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The reserve is operated in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA).\\n",
            "Jobos Bay is located on the south coast of Puerto Rico inAguirrebarrio, betweenSalinasandGuayama. Most of the land in the reserve is owned by a private company which leased the land to the Aguirre Corporation, which operated an extensive sugarcane farm and sugar mill in the region. After the burst of the sugar industry, Aguirre closed in 1980 and the land remains owned by the private corporation. The land has been offered to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico but because of financial troubles the purchase never concluded. The land remains under private ownership but part of the Bay is Federal Land. Baha de Jobos was established as a National Estuarine Sanctuary in 1981. Jobos Bay private lands remains the only undeveloped bay lands in the entire island, consisting of close to 160 hectares (400 acres) and more than 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of frontage to the bay. In fact, The Jobos Bay property controls most of the northern section of the Bay. It runs close to Aguirre Sugar Mill and all the way to the Eastern edge of Jobos Bay. This property can be developed for commercial and private use.[3]A new corporation was established in 2017 Jobos Bay Properties, Inc. to administer the sale of the land in private hands.[4]\\n",
            "Since the 1980s, land-use in the areas surrounding Baha de Jobos has continued to change. The Corporacion Amoros private reserve borders theAguirre State Foreston the East, a fisherman village (Las Mareas) on the West, and agricultural and residential land on the north. Due to urbanization in the region and shifting irrigation regimes, watershed dynamics have changed significantly.[citation needed]\\n"

For example, in 1599-1600 it was used by a group merchants-turned-pirates who, after learning of a Portuguese ship filled with gold, silver, precious stones, other treasures, attacked it and appropriated its contents. As they attempted to travel back to England, though, they faced an attempted mutiny and, surviving it, they took refuge at Caja de Muertos. Venturing to the Puerto Rico mainland for provisions, they were killed, except for one, who later confessed to the existence of the hidden treasure. The Spanish colonial governor then appropriated the remaining treasure for construction projects among other uses.[8]\\n"

The traditional continuous raisedverandahalong the front facade is broken up into two and twisted out of its usual linearity into the curved forms preserved today. Characteristic of the architecture to abound in Ponce contemporaneous to Castillo 34 is a profusion of appliqu, andeclecticcombination and juxtaposition of shapes, particularly curvilinear, and a general ostentation of articulation. Blas Silva was probably the most established of the \"wedding-cake architects\" and was thus sought after mostly by the \"nouveau riche\" of the period.

The wooden window designs became a typeface and inspiration for other private residences that were built afterwards in Yauco and beyond. The house is notable for the integration of various types of traditional construction techniques of time while also importing new techniques foreign in Puerto Rico at the time such as the use of forged cast iron in both the structural and ornamentation systems of the building.

Its designer was architect Antonio Mattei Lluberas, after whom the house is often named, a rich landowner ofCorsicanandCatalandescent who studied architecture in Paris. He later became famous for his opposition to the Spanish control of Puerto Rico and became an independence revolutionary leader in the failed1896and1897revolts inGuayanillaand Yauco, respectively. The 1897 revolt in Yauco became notable for being the first time when theflag of Puerto Ricowas raised in the island.[4]Mattei Lluberas became exiled after these attempts and returned to become mayor of Yauco during theSpanishAmerican War.

Construction of its replacement began soon after, although it was not completed until 1846. Four days after its dedication, an earthquake seriously damaged it. Repairs were not completed until 1882. The 1918 earthquake damaged the vault so badly that it was replaced by a flat concrete roof; a vaulted ceiling of composition board was placed inside.[2]\\n",
            "The cathedral of Arecibo is Puerto Rico\\'s second-largest church after theCatedral Metropolitana Baslica de San Juan Bautista. The plan is rectangular with three naves; the side naves are cut short to allow large flanking chapels, which occupy almost half the length of the church. The apse is semicircular, and has an unusual half-dome covering it. The facade is a triangular composition of three stages. The top stage, a short central tower, is a later addition, according to local architects and historians. Neoclassic ornamentation is used in an academic fashion on the lowest stage, but the other two show a less traditional use of bands and pilasters. The Renaissance-style windows are uncommon in Puerto Rican churches, but the central tower over the entrance is a common motif used throughout the island.\\n"

Many books assert that the soldier had been told he\\'d be taken to a lake filled with Tano women that he could havesexwith, and, once there, he found not women, but men who then proceeded to drown him. The other version has Salcedo being offered a ride across a river by Tanos who carried him on their arms, and then drowned him and kept him for days, afraid he\\'d still be alive and waiting until they were certain he was dead.[3]\\n",
            "A third, and most accepted version of Salcedo\\'s death says that the Tainos, fearing that the Spaniards might be gods, refrained from harming them. After suffering under the Spaniards for so long, the Tainos, by order of Ageyban, ambushed Salcedo as he was drinking water at the edge of a river. Fearing that Salcedo might resurrect after three days—based on their understanding of the Christian teachings wielded by Catholic priests—they sat around for three days waiting for Salcedo to come back from the dead, but all they saw was Salcedo\\'s body rotting due to the heat just as they would. At that moment the Tainos realized that these were no gods.[4]\\n"

The school\\'s main building is a historic structure located on Cristina Street, in thePonce Historic Zone. From its beginning the school has secured a unique place in Puerto Rico\\'s educational history. Of over 3,000 schools erected in Puerto Rico in the first quarter of the twentieth century, Ponce High was the largest, \"at a time enrolling more students than all the other Puerto Rico high schools combined\", and for many years enrolling more students than any other high school in Puerto Rico.[2]The cost of the building in 1915 dollars was $150,000USD($4.52 million in 2023 dollars[3]).[4]The building was listed on the U.S.National Register of Historic Placeson 4 August 1987.[5]The school has the only diamond-levelDECAchapter in Puerto Rico.[6]The Ponce High School building is \"among the most important public buildings ever built in Puerto Rico.\"[7]The school is the oldest continuously-operating high school in Puerto Rico.[1]\\n",
            "The history of the institution dates back to January 1899. On 25 January 1899 a historic fire took place on the lot currently occupied by the High School.[8]The fire is known as the \"Fuego del Polvorn\" (the Fire of the Ammunition Depot). At that time the lot was used as a U.S. Army ammunition depot. Today a register marks the location of the fire.[9]In November 1899, the new American government authorized the establishment of a public secondary school in Ponce modeled after the American school system. In 1903 the Roosevelt Industrial School was built on land where the US military had its munitions depot that caused the fire.[10]Five years afterEl Polvorin, in the 1904-1905 timeframe, a two-story building with 12 classrooms was built to accommodate the Ruiz Gandia Grammar School in the same spaciousEl Polvorinlot. The first class of Ponce High School students formed in 1902.[11]As new facilities were completed, the students were moved to them. For the 1907-1908 school year another building was built called the McKinley building, and the Ponce High students occupied said facilities as well. Construction of the now-historic Ponce High School building on Cristina Street started in 1915 and the building was inaugurated in 1920.[12]\\n"

Puerto Rican architect Miguel Ferrer and engineer Francisco Pons also worked on the property\\'s design with the purpose of taking advantage of the north breezes and natural light of the location. Pons and Ferrer hired Frank B. Hatch, who had worked with Nechodoma, also put some of his ideas in the design of the house. Finally, Ramn Aboy Lompr made his own suggestions for the house, which he would inhabit.\\n",
            "The house entrance features an ample house-wide porch with two posts, typical of Nechodoma\\'s style. The attic windows were altered to adorn the front of the house, and the tinted glass were bought on theDominican Republic. Aside of the porch, it also features ornamental tiles, a double interior staircase, and the style of the roof are all Nechodoma\\'s trademarks. However, unlike his style, the house features big rooms, and a wide hallway.[3]\\n"

Situated between theeponymousmain subrange ofCordillera Centraland theSierra de Cayeysubrange, San Cristbal measures 9 kilometers (5.5 mi) in length and reaches up to 750 feet (228.6 m) in depth, making it the deepestland canyonin Puerto Rico and theAntillesorWest Indiesof theCaribbean.[1][2]Home to some of the tallest waterfalls and hundreds of species offloraandfaunain the island, the canyon isgovernment-protectedas a natural area since 1978, which came after the site was used as aland fillfrom 1954 to 1974. San Cristbal and its northerly neighbor ofLas Bocas Canyonare part of a larger canyon system belonging to theLa Plata Riverbasinin the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico.[3][4][5]\\n",
            "The San Cristbal Canyon is mainly carved by the flow of theUsabn River, an eastward tributary of theLa Plata River(Ro de la Plata), which at approximately 46 miles (74 km) is the longest river in Puerto Rico. The river flow of the Usabn is fed by numerous tributaries, particularly the Aibonito and Barranquitas Rivers, which flow from the south and north of the canyon, respectively. These rivers are named after the municipalities they originate from, to which the Usabn functions as a natural municipal boundary. This river system, along with its wider hydrological basin of La Plata, have sculpted the canyonlands of the eastern Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. This process has created numerous waterfalls, some of which are the tallest in Puerto Rico. For example, La Vaca Falls (Salto La Vaca), at approximately 300 feet (91.4 m), is the tallest waterfall in the island.[4]This canyon system is much bigger than the San Cristbal and Las Bocas Canyons, and it includes other gorges and steep river valleys such as those of La Plata inComeroandArroyatainCidra. This canyon is notable for being the deepest canyon in the West Indies with a maximum depth of up to 800 feet (200 m).[3]\\n",
            "Before the flow of the Usabn River, the area where the San Cristbal Canyon is located was the location of a formerfault lineduring theLate Cretaceousperiod. This fault line might have contributed to the inward flow of previous rivers by creating a depression next to a rise of the superficial terrestrial crust along the region which began the process of carving the gorge approximately 90 million years ago. This hydrological process caused the movement of sediments which today are evident in the rich diversity of soil types that are found in the area.[3]\\n"

The urban forest has entrances onRoosevelt Avenueand Ensenada Street. The forest extends to almost 70 acres and it is the smallest protected area in the Puerto Rico state forest system. One of the most distinctive features of the forest is themogoteon its northern edge which can be observed from many parts of San Juan andGuaynabo.[1]The forest is part of theNorthern Karst.\\n",
            "The site of the forest was first developed foragricultureandcattle grazingand used to be a farm calledFinca San Patricio. There used to be three mogotes on the site but two were destroyed to make way for the construction of the Villa Borinquen neighborhood and the Borinquen Towers complex. The third mogote still exists and it hosts a communications tower. The rest of the land was originally acquired by the US Army with the intention of developing residences for nearbyFort Buchanan.[1]In 1962 the city of San Juan was experiencing a population boom and urban sprawl destroyed much of the original forest areas of the region. The area where the forest is located was not spared as if it was cleared to make way for more neighborhoods, and the only part of the forest to remain relatively untouched was that around the only remaining mogote. In 1960, the army left and abandoned the residences there and from 1974 to 1999 most of those residences were demolished.[2]At the time the land was owned by the governmental Corporation for Housing and Urban Development (Spanish:Corporacin de Renovacin Urbana y Vivienda) or CRUV (today known as thePuerto Rico Department of Housing) and the land was intended to be developed to build housing of social interest but these were never built and the modern forest started to grow in the abandoned land. The area was considered one of the last green zones in San Juan and as such in 1998 the environmentalist groupCiudadanos Pro Bosque San Patricio,[3]along with scientists and local residents, pushed to have the land be proclaimed a forest preserve. On August 3, 2000, the forest is proclaimed through an executive order and granted to thePuerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources(DRNA) to manage and preserve the secondary forest and its ecology. The goal of this proclamation is to preserve the forest for the purpose of recreation and scientific research.[1]After being closed due to the destruction caused byHurricane Mariain 2017, the forest has recently been revitalized and it re-opened in April of 2021.[4]\\n"

Later, New Century Development would file a counter lawsuit, when Plaza Las Americas announced their plans for an expansion.[5]The project was later given its current name, and finally broke ground in 2012. Original plans had included the construction of an office tower, a hotel and a casino, with work originally set to begin later in 2015, after the mall opened, and completed by 2017; however, this never came to fruition.\\n"

It is divided into two subspecies, theFlorida manatee(T. m. latirostris) in the United States and theAntillean manatee(T. m. manatus) in the Caribbean,[8][9]both of which are endangered and face pressure from habitat loss, pollution, and other human activity.

            "Whale watchingis the practice of observingwhalesanddolphins(cetaceans) in their natural habitat. Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf.birdwatching), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes.[1]A study prepared forInternational Fund for Animal Welfarein 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.[2]The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with thewhalingindustry about the best use of whales as anatural resource.\\n",
            "Organized whale watching started in the United States, when theCabrillo National MonumentinSan Diegowas declared a public venue for observing the migration ofgray whales; the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year, 1950.[1]In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters.[1]The industry spread throughout the western coast of the United States over the following decade.[1]\\n",
            "In 1971 theMontreal Zoological Societycommenced the first commercial whale watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in theSt. Lawrence Riverto viewfinandbeluga whales.[1]By the mid-1970s, live captures for aquaria had reduced the orca populations in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington, particularly thesouthern resident orcapopulation. According to their scientific chroniclers, in the 1980s commercial whale watching started becoming an alternative means of viewing and appreciating orcas.[3]In 1984,Erich Hoyt, who had spent much time amongst theorcasof British Columbia, published the first comprehensive book on whale watching,The Whale Watcher\\'s Handbook, whichMark Carwardinecalled his number one \"natural classic\" book inBBC Wildlifemagazine.[4]\\n"
