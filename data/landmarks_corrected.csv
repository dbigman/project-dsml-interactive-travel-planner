Farmers' markets exist in many countries worldwide and reflect the local culture and economy. The size of the market may be just a few stalls or it may be as large as several city blocks. Due to their nature, they tend to be less rigidly regulated than retail produce shops.[5]\\n"", 'They are distinguished from public markets, which are generally housed in permanent structures, open year-round, and offer a variety of non-farmer/non-producer vendors, packaged foods, and non-food products.[6][7]\\n', ""The current concept of a farmers' market is similar to past concepts but different in relation to other forms – as aspects of consumer retailing, overall, continue to shift over time. Similar forms existed before the Industrial Age, but often formed part of broader markets, where suppliers of food and other goods gathered to retail their wares. Trading posts began in the 1930s, a shift toward retailers who sold others' products more than their own. General stores and grocery stores continued that specialization trend in retailing, optimizing the consumer experience,[8] while abstracting it further from production and from production's growing complexities.[citation needed]\\n""]"

It is located between the municipalities of Camuy, Hatillo, and Lares in northwestern Puerto Rico, but the main entrance to the park is located in Quebrada, Camuy.[1][2] The caverns are part of a large network of natural limestone caves and underground waterways carved out by the third-largest underground river in the world, the Río Camuy (Camuy River).[5][6] The cave system was ""discovered"" in 1958 and was first documented in the 1973 book Discovery at the Río Camuy (ISBN 0-517-50594-0) by Russell and Jeanne Gurnee, but there is archaeological evidence that these caves were explored hundreds of years ago by the Taíno Indians, Puerto Rico's first inhabitants.[7][8] Over 10 miles of caverns, 220 caves, and 17 entrances[9] to the Camuy cave system have been mapped so far. This, however, is only a fraction of the entire system, which many experts believe still holds another 800 caves. \n Only a small part of the complex is open to the public. The 268-acre park built around the cave system features tours of some of the caves and sinkholes and is one of the most popular natural attractions in Puerto Rico.

The cost of the building in 1915 dollars was $150,000 USD ($4.52 million in 2023 dollars). The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 4 August 1987. The school has the only diamond-level DECA chapter in Puerto Rico. The Ponce High School building is ""among the most important public buildings ever built in Puerto Rico."" The school is the oldest continuously operating high school in Puerto Rico.

The history of the institution dates back to January 1899. On 25 January 1899, a historic fire took place on the lot currently occupied by the High School. The fire is known as the ""Fuego del Polvorín"" (the Fire of the Ammunition Depot). At that time, the lot was used as a U.S. Army ammunition depot. Today, a register marks the location of the fire. In November 1899, the new American government authorized the establishment of a public secondary school in Ponce modeled after the American school system. In 1903, the Roosevelt Industrial School was built on land where the U.S. military had its munitions depot that caused the fire. Five years after El Polvorín, in the 1904-1905 timeframe, a two-story building with 12 classrooms was built to accommodate the Ruiz Gandia Grammar School in the same spacious El Polvorín lot. The first class of Ponce High School students formed in 1902. As new facilities were completed, the students were moved to them. For the 1907-1908 school year, another building called the McKinley building was built, and the Ponce High students occupied said facilities as well. Construction of the now-historic Ponce High School building on Cristina Street started in 1915, and the building was inaugurated in"
