The school is located in Miramar, Puerto Rico's capital city of San Juan. Students, teachers, and alumni commonly refer to their school as Perpetuo.\\nThe goal of the Academia del Perpetuo Socorro is the complete development of the student—spiritually, mentally, morally, socially, culturally, and physically—in order to live a full life and to prepare for his/her final goal: union with God. To this end, the school works to create a Catholic academic community in which faith, knowledge, and recreation are shared in a spirit of freedom, love, and creativity. The school, however, does not emphasize religion over other subjects, accepts students of all faiths, and does not impose religious requirements such as baptism, confirmation, or church attendance as a condition for continued attendance."

It mainly consists of mangrove coasts, keys, and floodplain forests, and it borders the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. The Aguirre State Forest is owned and administered by Puerto Rico. It was established in 1918 by Puerto Rico governor Arthur Yager to protect the mangrove forest areas between the municipalities of Guayama and Santa Isabel (Punta Petrona).[1]\n\nThe state forest is named after the nearby Central Aguirre, a historic sugarcane plantation and refinery, and the barrio of Salinas of the same name. The forest is notable for its dense mangrove forests and salt ponds. As such, it is an ecologically diverse area that is home to 13 species of reptiles, 4 species of amphibians, and 3 species of bats. At least 184 bird species can be found within the forest, and the area is an important bird nesting site. Some notable bird species found here are yellow-crowned night herons (Nyctanassa violacea), mangrove rails (Rallus longirostris), yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), and endangered birds such as yellow-shouldered blackbirds (Agelaius xanthomus). Manatees can also be observed in the lagoons located in and around the forest.\n\nThe types of mangroves found within the state forest are white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus). Batis maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum, and Sporobolus virginicus are the main grass species found in the area, particularly around the tropical salt ponds and keys.[1]"

The festival has been celebrated for almost fifty years, and the first edition was celebrated in 1969.[2] Its original purpose was and still is to showcase Puerto Rico's flora and the island's floral industry. The festival was officially established for its second edition when the \"Festival de las Flores de Aibonito, Inc\" (\"Aibonito Festival of Flowers, Inc.\") was incorporated with the objective of promoting and celebrating the town's floriculture and agriculture. In 2017, Hurricane Maria brought a significant amount of rain, wind, and destruction which decimated the flower industry of Aibonito.[3] In 2020 and 2021,[4] the festival was canceled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico."

At the time, there were no graduate programs in clinical psychology in Puerto Rico. The University of Puerto Rico and the Normal School (later known as the College of Education) included psychology as part of the core curricula as early as 1903 but only for undergraduate studies that were heavily based on the American higher education system and its standards. Graduate-level degrees in psychology could only be obtained through schools in the United States.\\nBy the early 1960s, little had changed, with mental health professionals being trained abroad and then returning to their home country with the challenge of adapting what they had learned in the United States to fit the socio-cultural realities of a Hispanic community. Albizu-Miranda himself received his training at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and incurred the same difficulties of incorporating what he had learned into the culture of the island upon returning home to Puerto Rico."

The building has been called \"an icon of Ponce's architecture, history, and identity.\" It is owned and administered by the Ponce Municipal Government. In 1936, during the Great Depression, the Casino declared bankruptcy and shut down. It subsequently had various uses: a postal office, a public health unit, tax collector's office, and even a temporary city hall. In 1990 it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government, and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His Majesty Felipe de Borbon, took place.\n\nPonce had three casinos before this one. The first Casino de Ponce was founded in 1862, on Calle Marina. It met at the location that was later (in 1911) used by Rosendo Matienzo Cintron as his law office. The organization stopped meeting due to political quarrels between the two political factions in its membership representing groups for and against the government of Spanish General Sanz, but it reformed on 19 July 1876. This second Casino de Ponce was located on the second floor of the property owned by Don Carlos Cabrera Martinez, one of the distinguished members of the Ponce high society. Their meeting location was on an elegant structure at the northeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Cristina, facing Plaza Las Delicias. The third Casino de Ponce reformed on 29 June 1897. It met next to Teatro La Perla, on the east side of Calle Mayor, between Calle Isabel and Calle Cristina, immediately north of the theater. It moved 25 years later, in 1922, to the pompous locale at the southeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Luna, that is the subject of this article."

The building dates from 1896 or 1897. It was designed by the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers. The architecture consists of 19th-century Neoclassical architecture style. The building is of architectural significance since it is the only one-story building of this style remaining in the city of Ponce and one of the best examples on the Island. Completed in 1897, the year before the Spanish-American War of 1898, this building was the last major construction undertaken by the Spanish Government in the Americas. From 1905 to the mid-1970s the structure served as the Asilo de Ciegos de Ponce (Ponce Blind Asylum). As of 2020 the building sits abandoned.\n\nThe structure commonly known as the Asilo de Ciegos (Home of the Blind) was built between 1896 and 1897 to serve as a hospital for the city of Ponce's military garrison. The Royal Spanish Engineering Corps constructed this building in the then-popular neoclassical style which was common to the old San Juan area, but was not at the time prevalent in Ponce. This building, together with El Castillo (Ponce's Spanish military headquarters), Hospital Tricoche (Ponce's Municipal Hospital), and the Casa Alcaldía are the only remaining buildings representative of the Spanish Crown's interest in other areas of the Island besides San Juan."

Perched atop the Punta Morrillos headland since 1898, this iconic lighthouse was the last constructed under Spain's 300-year presence on the island. Despite the collapse of the Spanish Empire following the Spanish-American War that same year, the Arecibo Lighthouse endured.  \nThe lighthouse was designed in the neoclassical architectural style popular during the 19th century, featuring a stately rectangular building with an attached hexagonal tower. The rectangular keeper's house measures 40 feet 4 inches (12.29 m) wide by 84 feet 2 inches (25.65 m) long. The hexagonal tower is topped by a dome made of bronze that encases the working lantern room.  \nThe original lighting apparatus was a Fresnel lens of the third order, able to project a beam of light with a radius of 18 miles to warn approaching ships. In 1931, the lighthouse was modernized and converted to electric power. Today, the lantern houses a 190mm lens that emits a bright white flash repeating every five seconds."

A cable-mount steerable receiver and several radar transmitters for emitting signals were mounted 150 m (492 ft) above the dish. Completed in November 1963, the Arecibo Telescope was the world's largest single-aperture telescope for 53 years, until it was surpassed in July 2016 by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in Guizhou, China.\n\nThe Arecibo Telescope was primarily used for research in radio astronomy, atmospheric science, and radar astronomy, as well as for programs that search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Scientists wanting to use the observatory submitted proposals that were evaluated by independent scientific referees. NASA also used the telescope for near-Earth object detection programs. The observatory, funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with partial support from NASA, was managed by Cornell University from its completion in 1963 until 2011, after which it was transferred to a partnership led by SRI International. In 2018, a consortium led by the University of Central Florida assumed operation of the facility.\n\nThe telescope's unique and futuristic design led to several appearances in film, gaming, and television productions, such as for the climactic fight scene in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995). It is one of the 116 pictures included in the Voyager Golden Record. It has been listed on the US National Register of Historic Places since 2008.

The building was designed and built by commissioned state architects Manuel V. Domenech and Luis Perocier in 1895. The building as it stands today however was not fully completed until 1920 due to complications caused by the 1918 earthquake, after which it was restored and expanded. The institution was operated by the Sisters of Charity during its first years.[3]\\nFor some time, Salvador Agrón, the inspiration for the Broadway musical The Capeman, lived in the building with his mother. In 1962 it became an asylum for the elderly. The number of elderly patients increased, and, in 1967, occupational therapy and arts programs were added by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, who also ran the laundry, cafeteria, pharmacy, and others.[4]\\n"

The bay is an intertidal tropical ecosystem dominated by seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves.[2] In an area of 1,140 hectares (2,800 acres), the reserve contains five distinct habitat types and provides sanctuary to several endangered species. Bahía de Jobos is one of 28 reserves that comprise the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The reserve is operated in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA).\\nJobos Bay is located on the south coast of Puerto Rico in Aguirre barrio, between Salinas and Guayama. Most of the land in the reserve is owned by a private company which leased the land to the Aguirre Corporation, which operated an extensive sugarcane farm and sugar mill in the region. After the burst of the sugar industry, Aguirre closed in 1980 and the land remains owned by the private corporation. The land has been offered to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico but because of financial troubles the purchase never concluded. The land remains under private ownership but part of the Bay is Federal Land. Bahía de Jobos was established as a National Estuarine Sanctuary in 1981. Jobos Bay private lands remains the only undeveloped bay lands in the entire island, consisting of close to 160 hectares (400 acres) and more than 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of frontage to the bay. In fact, the Jobos Bay property controls most of the northern section of the Bay. It runs close to Aguirre Sugar Mill and all the way to the Eastern edge of Jobos Bay. This property can be developed for commercial and private use.[3] A new corporation was established in 2017 Jobos Bay Properties, Inc. to administer the sale of the land in private hands.[4]\\nSince the 1980s, land-use in the areas surrounding Bahía de Jobos has continued to change. The Corporación Amorós private reserve borders the Aguirre State Forest on the East, a fisherman village (Las Mareas) on the West, and agricultural and residential land on the north. Due to urbanization in the region and shifting irrigation regimes, watershed dynamics have changed significantly.[citation needed]"

            "The Ballajá Barracks (Cuartel de Ballajá in Spanish) is a historic building and former military barracks located in the Ballajá section of Old San Juan, in the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is located close to El Morro and its esplanade, between the Morovis, Beneficiencia, and Norzagaray streets. It was built from 1854 to 1864 to house Spanish and Puerto Rican regiments. The Ballajá Barracks were the last large-scale construction project made by the Spanish Crown in the Americas.[1]\\nThe building has been owned by the government of Puerto Rico since 1976 and today it houses the Museum of the Americas and the Puerto Rican Academy of the Spanish Language, in addition to several businesses and institutions such as a dance school, exhibition spaces, restaurants, and the State Office of Historic Conservation.[2]\\nThe Ballajá Barracks were built by the Spanish militia from 1854 to 1864. To build it, six blocks from the Ballajá subbarrio (in Old San Juan) were expropriated from the Dominican Order and demolished in 1853. The three-story structure was completed in 1864, occupying an area of 7,700 square meters (83,000 sq ft). It could accommodate over 1,000 citizens, originally Spanish soldiers and their families. Its vast interior patio is one of the best examples of 19th-century Spanish architecture in Puerto Rico.[3]\\n"

Although the specific date when the original chapel was constructed is not known, some records date it as far as 1590. Also, radiocarbon dating tests done to pieces of wood from a coffin found in the basilica point to the existence of the chapel as far back as 1570."

The Baños became a popular tourist attraction among the early Spanish settlers, which prompted the construction of a resort by local entrepreneurs. Coamo was the site of an important battle during the Puerto Rico Campaign of the Spanish-American War and was subject to artillery bombardments which damaged the resort. The historic Baños and resort were restored during the 20th century by the Government of Puerto Rico, becoming once more a popular tourist attraction.\\nThe Taínos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus and the Spanish conquistadors were the first to discover the hot spring waters of Coamo.[2] According to local legend, the first governor of Puerto Rico, Juan Ponce de León, heard about the healing powers of the Baños from the Taínos. Believing that the baths were the Fountain of Youth which he was seeking, Ponce de León asked where they were located; however, he misunderstood the instructions given to him and instead headed by sea towards a new land, which resulted in the discovery of Florida and his death.[3][4] During the mid-16th century, the word spread among the Spanish settlers of the healing powers of the six sulfur-rich spring waters, and as a consequence, many of the settlers began to make regular journeys from San Juan to the mountainous region to enjoy what they believed were the benefits of said waters.[2]"

They are commemorated on the feast day of Epiphany, sometimes called \"Three Kings Day,\" and commonly appear in the nativity celebrations of Christmas.\n\nThe Magi appear solely in the Gospel of Matthew, which states that they came \"from the east\" to worship the \"one who has been born king of the Jews.\" Their names, origins, appearances, and exact number are unmentioned and derive from the inferences or traditions of later Christians. In Western Christianity, they are usually assumed to have been three in number, corresponding with each gift; in Eastern Christianity, especially the Syriac churches, they often number twelve. Likewise, the Magi's social status is never stated: Although some biblical translations describe them as astrologers, they were increasingly identified as kings by at least the third century, which conformed with Christian interpretations of Old Testament prophecies that the messiah would be worshipped by kings.\n\nThe mystery of the Magi's identities and background, combined with their theological significance, has made them prominent figures in the Christian tradition; they are venerated as saints or even martyrs in many Christian communities, and are the subject of numerous artworks, legends, and customs. Both secular and Christian observers have noted that the Magi popularly serve as a means of expressing various ideas, symbols, and themes. Most scholars regard the Magi as legendary rather than historical figures."

Carnegie's private secretary, James Bertram, indicated that the amount usually donated was 10 times the promised maintenance expenses. Nevertheless, Brumbaugh obtained the $100,000 amount.[4] This was in part due to then-Governor Arthur Yager's friendship with Carnegie himself.[6] Its origins stem from the Insular Library created in 1903, established by the then-new civil government, which itself came from the military-rule era San Juan Free Library, which was a merger of five pre-existing libraries under Spanish rule: the library of the Dominican and Franciscan monasteries, the Real Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País, the library of the Provincial Council[es] and Treasury Department of Puerto Rico, the library of the Royal College of Lawyers-General Secretary, and the library of the Institute of Secondary Education and Normal School.[2][7]  \nIt has Classical Revival stylings and was designed and built by the Puerto Rican engineer Ramón Carbia in 1914, when work on the project commenced on land donated by the Puerto Rico government.[2][4] In June 1916, the collection of the Insular Library, which had previously been known as the San Juan Public Library,[5] was transferred to the building, and the library, which was named Biblioteca Carnegie, itself was inaugurated on 27 July,[4] when the Puerto Rican government formally accepted the donation.[2] From 1917 until 2010, the library was administered by the Department of Education.[5] In its first forty years of service, the library had nine reading rooms, membership, with an average of 200 daily visitors.[2][4] Under the 222 Law of 1946, a $6,000 amount was made available to the library's board of trustees, with the intent of establishing the Biblioteca Rodante (\"Library on Wheels\"). The then-Department of Public Instruction was authorized to organize and equip the Biblioteca Rodante, which offered its services through the use of cajas viajeras (\"traveling boxes\"), which were shelves used to carry books to isolated schools and communities.[4] The project started in 1948 under the direction of Federico Porrata Dora, Francisco Porrata-Dora's brother, with two vehicles carrying books for children and adults, as users ranged from elementary-level school children to adults aged eighty to ninety years old.[2]"

After being imported to Puerto Rico, there were plans for it to be erected in Cataño. After being moved to Mayagüez and facing further delays, Birth of the New World was assembled at its current location.\n\nOriginally designed by Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli as a monument to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first voyage, Birth of the New World was constructed in 1991. The statue prominently depicts Columbus controlling an anachronistic depiction of a steering wheel, with a backdrop featuring the Niña, Pinta, and Santa María traversing the Atlantic Ocean.[2] Made of 2,750 bronze and steel pieces and weighing more than 1,300,000 pounds (650 short tons; 590 tonnes), the monument's 360 ft (110 m) height made it the tallest in the Western Hemisphere during the last decade of the 20th century, dwarfing the Statue of Liberty[3] and the Monumento a la Virgen de la Paz."

The Center is owned by Bolera Caribe, Inc., a private company.[3] The bowling center was inaugurated in November 2004.[4]  \nThe Bolera de Ponce, as Bolera Caribe was previously called, was inaugurated in Ponce in the mid-1950s in the Mariani sector of barrio Primero of Ponce. As the 1990s progressed, the neighborhood where the Bolera was located showed signs of aging and began to decay. This was a problem for the company, as it was inconsistent with the image it wanted to portray and the type of clientele it was seeking to continue attracting."

In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Boquerón was 1,185.[10]\n\nPeople from the El Combate community in barrio Boquerón are known as mata con hacha (\"those who kill with axes\") based on an old folk tale about a fight over the salinas, where those from Cabo Rojo fought with axes against people from the adjacent town of Lajas. The latter apparently fought back by throwing stones and are thus known as tira piedras (\"those who throw stones\").[11]"

It was proclaimed and designated a forest preserve in 1918 by Puerto Rico governor Arthur Yager with the purpose of preserving the mangrove biomes in Cabo Rojo and Lajas. Two additional segments, the Guayacán and Cuevas Keys, were added in 1943. The areas of the Molino mangroves, Los Morrillos (famous for its lighthouse) and the Guaniquilla Lagoon and surrounding mangroves were annexed to the Boquerón State Forest in 1980.[1]\n\nThe state forest today is managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and extends across 9 management segments across three municipalities:[1][5]"

Studies estimate the in-situ courts to be over 700 years old, built by the Taíno around 1270 AD.[5][6]\\nApproximately 13 ball courts and plazas (bateyes) have been identified and many have been restored to their original state. Monoliths and petroglyphs carved by the Taínos can be seen among the rocks and stones, some weighing over a ton, that were most likely brought from the Tanamá River located adjacent to the site.[7]\\nThe site also contains the largest concentration of petroglyphs in the Antilles,[8] most of which are found carved into the stone monoliths that form the bateyes or ball courts. Some of the most famous pictographs include a heron-like bird and atabeyra, also known as the \"Caguana woman\",[8] attributed to the fertility zemi or goddess Atabey.[9]\\n"

This building hosted municipal offices until 2010 when the new city hall building was inaugurated. The building now houses several cultural institutions including a museum dedicated to the history of Caguas. The building of a new city hall was part of a project to develop and build more modern office and administrative spaces in the city. Some people, however, have criticized the continuous use of Brutalist architecture in new government buildings. The new city hall building, nicknamed \"El Cacique Mayor\" (Spanish for 'the major cacique'), was inaugurated in September 2010 by Caguas mayor William Edgardo Miranda Torres."

            "The Capitol of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Capitolio de Puerto Rico), also known as Casa de las Leyes (House of Laws), and most commonly referred to as El Capitolio (The Capitol), is the seat of the Legislative Assembly, or the bicameral legislature, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives, responsible for the legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico. Located on San Juan Islet immediately outside the Walls of Old San Juan, the oceanfront, neoclassical Beaux-Arts-style, entirely white marble-covered edifice was constructed between 1921 and 1929 to resemble the ancient Roman Pantheon in Rome, using as inspiration the Low Memorial Library in New York City. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.[3][4][5]\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Capitol, the Legislative Assembly used the Provincial Delegation Building, which now houses the Department of State.[6] The idea of constructing a capitol was first introduced by former Resident Commissioner Luis Muñoz Rivera in 1907, and was partly meant to demonstrate some degree of civilian rule on the island, which at the time was already a colony of the United States.[7] The project proposed by Muñoz Rivera assigned $3 million for the construction and established rules for a contest among architects to decide which one would do the work.\n\nIn September 1907, Commissioner of the Interior Laurence Grahame sent the official request for architects through the press and magazines of the United States. The specifications for the building were that it was supposed to have three principal installations: the Executive Council, the House of Delegates, and the Supreme Court. It was supposed to be simple, conservative, and appropriate to the island's weather conditions. 134 architectural designs were submitted from the US, Cuba, Canada, France, Spain, and Puerto Rico."

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 5 March 1986, as Fernando Luis Toro Casa. It is also known as Casa Chavier. The house was sold by its original owners in the early 1970s to Mr. Jorge Chavier and his wife Ms. Hilda de Lis, who still occupied the house in 1986.[4]"

            "Casa Font-Ubides (English: Font-Ubides House), also known as the Residencia Monsanto (English: Monsanto Residence), is a historic building located on the north side of Castillo Street in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the city's historic district. The building dates from 1913. It was designed by the architect Blas Silva. The architecture consists of 19th-century Classical Revival and Art Nouveau architectural styles. The building is of architectural significance for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornaments. The complete preservation of the original architecture of the Monsanto Residence, its unique design amongst the houses of Ponce, and its location within the historic urban core of the city qualify it as one of a series of grand houses and an integral part of the character of Ponce.[1]\n\nThe Monsanto Residence at Calle Castillo No. 34 is an architectural landmark in the city of Ponce. Designed by the well-known architect Blas Silva in 1913, the residence stands out among the great houses of Ponce for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornament. Adapting the curves of the \"Art Nouveau\" to the persistent Neo-classicism of Puerto Rico and the recently born Creole vocabulary of Ponce, Silva succeeded in creating a movement in architecture which broke away from the traditional forms while remaining within them. The traditional continuous raised verandah along the front facade is broken up into two and twisted out of its usual linearity into the curved forms preserved today. Characteristic of the architecture to abound in Ponce contemporaneous to Castillo 34 is a profusion of appliqué, an eclectic combination and juxtaposition of shapes, particularly curvilinear, and a general ostentation of articulation. Blas Silva was probably the most established of the \"wedding-cake architects\" and was thus sought after mostly by the \"nouveau riche\" of the period. Silva's houses are among the richest in Ponce, among which the Monsanto Residence stands out for its circular porches. Other buildings by Blas Silva include the Frau Residence and the Salazar-Candal Residence, both also listed in the NRHP.[1]"

The house was acquired and restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture and now operates as the Museo de la Arquitectura Ponceña (Museum of Ponce Architecture). The house sits in the Ponce Historic Zone. The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of the Classical Revival style used in Ponce designs in the early part of the 20th century and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built by Alfredo B. Wiechers, so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce.[2]\\nThe Wiechers-Villaronga Residence was built in 1912 by Alfredo B. Wiechers, architect, for his own residence and studio, which he sold later to Mr. Julio Mercado, who in turn gave it to his daughter, Elena Mercado and her husband Mr. Gabriel Villaronga as a wedding present. Wiechers was born in Ponce and studied at the School of Architecture in Paris, France, in 1901, where he was bestowed a gold medal for outstanding achievement and excellence during his professional studies. He graduated in 1905 and worked at the office of Enric Sagnier, a famous Spanish architect, in Barcelona, Spain. In 1911, he decided to work and live in Ponce; thus he designed and built his house and studio which he opened in 1912. In a short period of time, from 1911 to 1918, Wiechers was commissioned with various important buildings such as: the Loggia Aurora, Club Deportivo de Damas, the Havana Theatre, Banco of Ponce Building, and Santo Asilo de Damas Hospital among others, where he fully expressed the European Neo-Classical style which he learned from, and was influenced by, Enric Sagnier.[2]\\nThe Neo-Classical influence is manifested in most of his buildings and particularly in the Villaronga residence for its richness and highly decorative details (pilasters, rusticated podium, cornices, \"candelabra\", relief and motifs, Ionic capitals, etc. are some of the decorative details of the Neo-Classical trend). The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of this style and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built by Wiechers, so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce.[2]\\n"

            "Castillo Serrallés (English: Serrallés Castle) is a mansion located in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico, overlooking the downtown area (Ponce Pueblo). It was built during the 1930s for Juan Eugenio Serrallés, son of businessman Juan Serrallés, founder of Destilería Serrallés. The structure sits on a 2.5-acre (1.0 ha) exceedingly manicured property.[1] Nowadays, the structure functions as a museum, Museo Castillo Serrallés, with information about the sugar cane and rum industries and their impact on the economy of Puerto Rico. It is also increasingly used as a venue for social activities, including destination weddings.[3] The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2001.[4] In 1996, the structure was featured in the American TV series America's Castles.[5]\n\nThe house was purchased by the city of Ponce from the Serrallés heirs. While the castle was valued at US$17–US$25 million,[6] it was purchased for a mere US$400,000 and included much of the furniture in the sale.[7] The city's initial intent was to turn it into a museum of Puerto Rican music.[7] The Museum of Puerto Rican Music was eventually established elsewhere in the city."

A large portion of the swamp, located in Arecibo, is protected as the Caño Tiburones Nature Reserve.[1]\\nThe average annual temperature is 80°F (26.9°C). Precipitation varies from 1,000 to 2,000 mm of average annual rain; it is rainiest during the wet season, from May to September.[1]\\nThe swamp is located north of the Northern Karst zone of Puerto Rico and lies above a wide limestone area. Most of the terrain in the area consists of swamp deposits made of clay and silt with smaller quantities of sand and peat. Most of the soil is hydric and organic with high acidity and poor drainage, which sustains the swampy terrain.[1]\\n"

However, it remained inactive and without organization until 1976, when Ricardo Alegría made a request before the Council on Higher Education of Puerto Rico to transform the center into an academic institution.[5]\\nWith the CEAPRC, Alegría intended for a small institution that possessed an intimate environment, with intellectual growth and the promotion of a region-wide Caribbean emphasis as its focus.[6] In her 2002 book, Carmen Dolores Hernández credited the CEAPRC (which she labels an \"experimental\" institution \"unparalleled in the island or the Antilles\") with breaking away from the \"cultural eurocentrism\" of higher education in Puerto Rico.[7] The curriculum was intended to be different from that of the universities.[8] Puerto Rico and the Antilles received a central role with historic archaeology, local literature and history in the spotlight. Besides numerous local sites, archaeological digs were also held by students in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. Foreign professors such as Irving Rouse, Peter Roe, Mario Veloz Maggiolo, Sally Price and Lourdes Domínguez also collaborated with the CEAPRC. Students were allowed to take courses from other universities.[9] On at least one occasion, a course was added due to student initiative.\\n"

The discovery provides an insight as to how the indigenous tribes of the Igneri and Taínos lived and played during and before the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the New World. Tibes is the oldest Antillean Indian ceremonial and sports complex yet uncovered in Puerto Rico. Within its boundaries is also the largest indigenous cemetery discovered to date, consisting of 186 human skeletons, most from the Igneri and the rest from the pre-Taíno cultures. Based on the orientation of the ceremonial plazas, this is also believed to be the oldest astronomical observatory in the Antilles. The museum was established in 1982 and restored in 1991.\n\nThe Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is one of the largest and most significant indigenous sites in the Caribbean islands, and is the largest ceremonial site in Puerto Rico."

            "Christopher Columbus (/kəˈlʌmbəs/; between 25 August and 31 October 1451 – 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer and navigator from the Republic of Genoa who completed four Spanish-based voyages across the Atlantic Ocean sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs, opening the way for the widespread European exploration and colonization of the Americas. His expeditions were the first known European contact with the Caribbean and Central and South America.\n\nThe name Christopher Columbus is the anglicisation of the Latin Christophorus Columbus. Growing up on the coast of Liguria, he went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana. He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, who bore a son, Diego, and was based in Lisbon for several years. He later took a Castilian mistress, Beatriz Enríquez de Arana, who bore a son, Ferdinand."

Construction on the church began in 1661; it has since been judged \"one of the most important works of religious architecture in Puerto Rico\".[2]  \nThe church is separated from the open plaza below by a series of ceremonial steps and a delicate cast iron balustrade. The delicately curved Baroque facade reflects a major reconstruction completed in 1784. A two-level bell-gable with open arches and bells is prominently featured in the facade. The parish of San Blas of Coamo is one of the oldest on the island.[2][3][4]  \nThis article incorporates public domain material from Church of San Blas de Illescas of Coamo. National Park Service."

Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.[6][7]\\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) (Spanish: a propósito para las fiestas), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (Spanish: grandeza proporcionada al número de vecinos). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.[6]\\n"

            "The Co-Cathedral Dulce Nombre de Jesús, in English, Co-Cathedral of the Sweet Name of Jesus, is a Catholic cathedral located on the town plaza in Humacao, Puerto Rico. Along with the Catedral Santiago Apóstol in Fajardo, it is the seat of the Diocese of Fajardo-Humacao.[1]\\nThe first church for the parish of Dulce Nombre de Jesús was a simple structure built in 1769.[2] A second church was built from 1825 to 1826. It was in a ruinous state by 1860 and the present church was built between 1868 and 1877. It was designed by Don Evaristo de Churruca in the Gothic Revival style. The bell tower collapsed as the result of an earthquake in 1918. The church was repaired in 1928 and another renovation took place in the 1980s. Dulce Nombre de Jesús became a cathedral church when Pope Benedict XVI established the Diocese of Fajardo-Humacao on March 11, 2008.[3] The church was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984, using the name style Church Dulce Nombre de Jesús of Humacao.[4] It was later listed on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones on May 16, 2001.[5]\\nThe cathedral is on the east side of the town plaza. A low concrete wall with metal grillwork surrounds the church building. The wall is modulated by pillars that hold cast iron lamps. The building is cruciform in shape with a nave, transept, and two side aisles. It is one of the few churches in Puerto Rico with a transept.[6] The main façade is dominated by a four-level square bell tower topped with a spire. It is flanked by two smaller round towers that house a spiral staircase and the weights for the clock. All the windows and doorways are framed with moldings. Small buttresses flank pointed arch windows on the sides of the building. The two-level transept is crowned with a gabled roof. Each side has two pointed-arch windows on the first level and a round window in the second."

Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.[8][9]\\n\\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) (Spanish: a propósito para las fiestas), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (Spanish: grandeza proporcionada al número de vecinos). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.[8]"

Inspired by the 1969 Stonewall Revolt, this was the first organized attempt to confront social, political and legal discrimination against the local LGBTQ community by pioneering resistance to discrimination through political action, educational programs, public awareness and social support to the community.[2]\\nAlthough Comunidad de Orgullo Gay disbanded in 1976, Casa Orgullo remains a symbol of gay rights in Puerto Rico, and it is considered a social historic site due to its importance in spearheading the gay liberation movement in the island. Forty years later, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 2016.[3]\\n"

'water eye', Spanish for 'spring' or 'water source'), also referred to as Manantial Ojo de Agua, a natural spring which was a source of water for Spanish soldiers, and the source of a small rivulet locally called Chico River ('little river') which empties into the Aguadilla Bay. The park is located in downtown Aguadilla and, in addition to the Ojo de Agua, it commemorates historic figures from the history of Aguadilla such as poet José de Diego. Before the establishment of El Parterre, the Ojo de Agua served as a water source for the first European settlers of modern-day Aguadilla. Before the founding of Aguadilla, the site around the water source was used by Sir Francis Drake as a resupplying base in 1595. The spring kept being used as a primary water source for Spanish soldiers and later on by the first European settlers of the region between the 16th and 18th centuries, who named the new town San Carlos de La Aguadilla partially after the Ojo de Agua (Aguadilla is also the diminutive of Aguada, the name of the older town located directly to the south). The site was also visited and mentioned by the Benedictine monk and historian Fray Íñigo Abad y La Sierra, who described it as a site of great beauty."

            "The Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Spanish: Catedral San Juan Bautista) is an Episcopal cathedral in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is the seat of the Diocese of Puerto Rico and it is located in the Santurce district of San Juan.[1]\\nThe first service of the Mission of St. John the Baptist was held on March 12, 1899, in a hall on the plaza in Old San Juan.[2] The Rev. James Van Buren came to Puerto Rico in February 1901 and on Christmas Eve of that year St. John's became a parish with Van Buren as the first rector. The cornerstone for the congregation's first church was laid on December 26, 1902. Old San Juan increasingly became a commercial center and its residents moved elsewhere. In 1928 Bishop Charles Colmore proposed relocating St. John's and St. Luke's Church to new locations. The following year the bishop spoke of St. John's and St. Catherine's Training School for Women relocating to Santurce with the hope that St. John's Day School and the rectory would join them. The groundbreaking for the present church took place on February 22, 1929, and it was completed the following February."

            "Flamenco Beach is a public beach on the Caribbean island of Culebra (Spanish pronunciation: [kuˈleβɾa]). It is known for its shallow turquoise waters, white sand, swimming areas, and diving sites. It stretches for a mile around a sheltered, horseshoe-shaped bay. Playa Flamenco is a popular beach destination for both Culebra and Puerto Rico. In March 2014, Flamenco Beach was ranked 3rd best beach in the world with a TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Award.[1][2] In August 2016, it was announced that Flamenco Beach had regained its Blue Flag Beach international distinction.[3]\n\nFlamenco is located on the northern shore of Culebra. Its name in Spanish (flamingo beach) comes from the numerous Caribbean flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) that were once common in Flamenco Lagoon.[4] The beach lies on a half-mile-wide, horseshoe strip of coast. The beach is bordered by the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge, which is itself one of the oldest wildlife preserves in the United States. Off the coast of Flamenco, approximately a quarter mile, is a reef where the surf breaks. Characteristic of Flamenco is the beach's white sand and shallow clear waters.[5][6]\n\nThe waters off Flamenco Beach are home to species of parrotfish, blue tang, multiple species of wrasse, and other Caribbean sea fish species. Crustacean species such as ghost crabs are also observed. Some 50,000 seabirds visit Culebra's Flamenco Peninsula each summer to nest, mostly sooty terns and other migratory species. Summer visitors to Flamenco Beach are familiar with them as they often feed in the area in large numbers. By September, the birds have gathered up their broods and flown out to sea only to return home the following summer. Occasionally, leatherback and hawksbill sea turtles may be seen as the beaches of the Culebra archipelago are also a major breeding ground for them, and the adjacent sea grass beds provide shelter and food for green sea turtles.[7]"

            "Francisco Manuel Oller y Cestero (June 17, 1833 – May 17, 1917) was a Puerto Rican painter, the only Latin American painter to have played a role in the development of Impressionism. One of the most distinguished transatlantic painters of his day, Oller helped transform painting in the Caribbean. Francisco Manuel Oller y Cestero was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, the third of four children of aristocratic and wealthy Spanish parents Cayetano Juan Oller y Fromesta and María del Carmen Cestero Dávila. When he was eleven, he began to study art under the tutelage of Juan Cleto Noa, a painter who had an art academy in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, Oller demonstrated that he had an enormous talent in art, and in 1848, when Oller was fifteen years old, General Juan Prim, Governor of Puerto Rico, offered Oller the opportunity to continue his studies in Rome. However, the offer was not accepted as Oller's mother felt that he was too young to travel abroad alone. When Oller was eighteen, he moved to Madrid, Spain, where he studied painting at the Royal Academy of San Fernando, under the tutelage of Don Federico de Madrazo y Kuntz, director of the Prado Museum. In 1858, he moved to Paris, France, where he studied under Thomas Couture. Later, he enrolled to study art in the Louvre under the instruction of Gustave Courbet. During his free time, Oller, who had a baritone type of singing voice, worked and participated in local Italian operas. He frequently visited cafés where he met with fellow artists. He also became a friend of fellow Puerto Ricans Ramón Emeterio Betances y Alacán and Salvador Carbonell del Toro, who were expatriates in France because of their political beliefs. In 1859, Oller exhibited some of his artistic works next to those of Bazille, Renoir, Monet, and Sisley."

In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico, finding that the combined population of Beatriz and Guavate barrios was 853.[7]  \nGuavate is known for its \"pork highway\" (a stretch of Puerto Rico Highway 184) and was featured in the Discover Puerto Rico tourism campaign of 2019 for being a must-see place in Puerto Rico because of its tender pork cuisine, mild weather, and scenic views of Sierra de Cayey.[13][14] The Carite State Forest is located nearby."

It remained operational from 1830 to 1880.[2]  \nThe plantation depended on mechanized technology along with slaves, who numbered 175 in 1873. The first mill on the plantation produced 100-150 tons of raw sugar every harvest. A second mill is estimated to have generated 200 tons, while a third mill produced between 500-600 tons.[3]  \nTwo steam engines were purchased to mechanize sugar production at the hacienda: one in 1841 and another in 1861. The steam trapiche purchased in 1861 remains on the property, making it the last known engine of its kind that remains preserved.[4][5] The Hacienda La Esperanza steam engine has been designated a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. Today, the entire property is owned by the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust (FCPR, for the initials in Spanish), which preserves and protects it. The property includes some of the only coastal forest left in the region. The organization Para La Naturaleza manages visitation to the historic site, in addition to educational and cultural activities and tours into the surrounding nature reserve.[6]"

As a result, Klumb moved to the island in 1944 with his wife, Else, and their two children, Peter and Richard. Klumb bought the Cody Ranch in 1947, and the remodeling began in 1949.

            "Hotel El Convento is a small hotel in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, in what was a Carmelite convent, adjoining the San Juan Cathedral square. The cathedral is the second-oldest cathedral in the Western Hemisphere. Hotel El Convento is the oldest member of the Historic Hotels of America. It was also named the premier Small Luxury Hotel in Puerto Rico by the Small Luxury Hotels of the World organization.  \nIn 1646, construction began on the Carmelite convent, through a petition by King Philip IV of Spain. The Monasterio del Señor San José de la Orden de Nuestra Señora del Carmen (Monastery of Our Lady Carmen of San Jose) was founded in 1651 by Doña Ana Lanzós, a wealthy widow who donated her money and her magnificent residence (a large double-sloped tiled roof) on the street that since then bears her name: de las Monjas. Historian María de los Ángeles Castro tells us that the delay in the arrival of a nunnery was due to economic reasons but also to a lack of defense since the fortifications of the city were not yet complete. Three nuns brought especially from Santo Domingo served as founders.  \nThe building was expanded between 1854 and 1861 after the original building was torn down. Governor Fernando Norzagaray y Escudero personally helped to raise the necessary funds and inspected the work daily. Certain elements stand out in the facade of the chapel, beside the entrance: the pair of Tuscan columns, the two towers, and the latticed choir arch. The frieze above the door is interrupted for a legend that was never placed. The building was closed from 1903 to 1959 and then sold. During its conversion to a hotel, the two towers were removed, as was the cross that identified the site as a convent."

Since October 1992, its headquarters have been located at the site of the old colonial Spanish Welfare House in Old San Juan.\n\nThe ICP was created by order of Law Number 89, signed June 21, 1955, and it started operating in November of that year. Its first Executive Director was sociologist and archaeology PhD Ricardo Alegría, who felt that \"There was a need to counteract decades of harmful influences, which at times were openly contradictory to our cultural values, with an effort to promote those values. There was an urgent need to struggle against a psychological conditioning which had become deeply rooted in our colonial society, and which led many Puerto Ricans to systematically diminish anything autochthonous or anything that seemed autochthonous, while disproportionately valuing everything that was foreign, or that seemed foreign.\" It was in this social and sociological environment that the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña was born. The bill provoked fierce debate as, for some whose political views were in favor of the direction Puerto Rican politics had been taking in the several years prior to the debate, the bill touched on the very essence of the political status of Puerto Rico. Once the bill was signed into law, the controversy created by the new government institution did not end."

Initially, portions of the site contained a Spanish fortification, the Bastion de San Justo del Muelle, which was built in 1639 (shortly after the city was invaded by the Dutch) and remained in place until 1897. The southern portion of the site contained a building that was likely a Spanish custom house constructed during the 1830s.[2]\n\nIn 1898, the U.S. Government took possession of Puerto Rico and established a presence on the island.

He was of predominant African ancestry and of partial Italian ancestry through his mother. He took his elementary studies in Dorado. After that, he pursued studies in the nearby town of Toa Baja. During weekends, he worked as a mason and carpenter to pay for his studies. He finished his studies at Central High School in Santurce in 1923.[2]  \nAt this time, his family moved to the town of Cataño, and he began studies at the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras. He received his bachelor's degree as a teacher of industrial arts, drawing, and carpentry. After several years working in various places, he started working as a teacher in 1937 at a school in San Germán. From there, he was transferred to another school in Canóvanas."

The hotel was publicly owned by the government of Puerto Rico and managed by the US-based Associated Federal Hotels chain.[3] The main hotel building was designed by architects Osvaldo Toro and Miguel Ferrer, of the firm Toro Ferrer. The two men had previously designed the first modern luxury resort in San Juan, the Caribe Hilton. Another part of the complex, the seashell-inspired building for the restaurant La Perla, was designed by architect Mario Salvadori.[4] The hotel's design incorporated tropical climate features such as cross-ventilation, natural illumination, open lobbies, and seamless transitions between inside and outside spaces, with details supposedly relevant to Island traditions: an interior patio, blinds, a mirador encompassing both the sea and the city, and the use of water throughout as a leitmotif. The protective concrete element in the façade, called brise-soleil in French or quiebrasol in Spanish, is an architectural element used by famed architect Le Corbusier. The purpose of the quiebrasol is to filter the sun's rays towards the interior corridors.\\nIn 1973, the La Concha Hotel was united with the adjacent Condado Beach Hotel into one hotel, known as the Hyatt Puerto Rico.[5] In 1976,[6] management of the complex was taken over by Hilton International[7] and the resort was renamed the Condado Beach La Concha Convention Center, with a huge convention wing built between the two existing hotel structures to physically connect them. The complex was later taken over by Carnival Cruise Line[8] and renamed The Condado Beach Trio, before the La Concha wing was closed in 1995, followed by the closure of the Condado Beach wing in 1997.[9] The government-owned properties sat vacant for years and were finally severed in 2004. The convention center that joined them was demolished to build a public park.[10]"

The total land area of the reserve is 218 acres. The nature reserve is also important for local fishermen and eastern coastal municipalities, including Fajardo, Ceiba, and Naguabo, which depend on the reserve for their fishing industries.[4][5]\n\nAlthough occasionally included as part of the reserve, the cays and reefs outside the chain that lie immediately next and parallel to the main coastline of Puerto Rico in Fajardo and Ceiba are not strictly protected by the reserve. From north to south, these are: Obispo cay, Zancudo cay, Roncador reef, Mata Caballos reef, Corona Carrillo reef, Ahogado cay, Ramos island, Largo cay, Piero island, Cabeza de Perro cay, Pierito cay, Cabras cay, and Cabras island."

The romantic area was frequented by families and sweethearts alike, especially on weekends, for relaxation and bonding. During the administration of Mayor Cordero, however, a number of facilities were added to the La Guancha area at a cost of over $18 million, developing it into a new recreational complex.[5] The new facilities followed the design of engineer Axel Bonilla Cortes.[6]"

Initially, the area was the site of a slaughterhouse because the law required the homes of slaves and homeless black and colored servants – as well as cemeteries – to be established away from the main community center: in this case, outside the city walls. Sometime after, some of the farmers and workers started living around the slaughterhouse and shortly established their houses there.\\nLocated inside the Old San Juan Historic District, La Perla (The Pearl) was originally the site of a slaughterhouse, called El Matadero. It was built in the 18th century outside the walls of San Juan by slaves who were required to live outside the city. Slaves built homes and lived near the slaughterhouse and later jíbaros (Puerto Rican farmers) who moved to San Juan, lived there.[1]"

La Placita today is a popular dining and nightlife destination in San Juan, while still functioning as a produce and food market during the day.[1]  \nThe market square was established in 1910 when the area was selected by Puerto Rico's government to build a marketplace. The marketplace building had two levels, the first one for kiosks, food and produce stalls and other service businesses, while the second level had the butcher and the meat market. The building originally also had business spaces, including medical offices. The market square building has been renovated and modified on numerous occasions throughout the 20th century, and at some point the second level was demolished to increase the area of the main marketplace.[2] The marketplace lost its importance in the later second half of the 20th century which left the area in various stages of disrepair. The building and the neighborhood were revitalized in the 1990s and 2000s when numerous restaurant and entertainment businesses opened. The area is now one of the liveliest social districts in San Juan and it is famous for its nightlife and gastronomy with its numerous restaurants, cafés, bars and dance clubs.[3][4][5]  \nDuring the day, La Placita de Santurce is a farmer's market.[5] It is located about ten minutes walking distance from the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art.[6]"

            "Diego Salcedo (died 1511) was a semi-legendary Spanish conquistador who is said to have lived during the colonization of the Americas.[1] According to legend, his death at the hands of the indigenous Taíno people ignited the Taíno rebellion of 1511.\\nAccording to the story, Salcedo died in 1511, during a trip to Puerto Rico, when Taínos, under the command of Ageyban II (brother of the great Taíno Cacique Ageyban) and the Cacique of Aasco, Urayoán, drowned him in the Río Grande de Aasco.[2] Historically, two versions about how Salcedo was lured to his death have collided. Many books assert that the soldier had been told he'd be taken to a lake filled with Taíno women that he could have sex with, and, once there, he found not women, but men who then proceeded to drown him. The other version has Salcedo being offered a ride across a river by Taínos who carried him on their arms, and then drowned him and kept him for days, afraid he'd still be alive and waiting until they were certain he was dead.[3]\\nA third, and most accepted version of Salcedo's death says that the Taínos, fearing that the Spaniards might be gods, refrained from harming them. After suffering under the Spaniards for so long, the Taínos, by order of Ageyban, ambushed Salcedo as he was drinking water at the edge of a river. Fearing that Salcedo might resurrect after three days—based on their understanding of the Christian teachings wielded by Catholic priests—they sat around for three days waiting for Salcedo to come back from the dead, but all they saw was Salcedo's body rotting due to the heat just as they would. At that moment the Taínos realized that these were no gods.[4]\\n"

The state forest is located in the municipalities of Jayuya and Ciales.[1]\\nLos Tres Picachos State Forest was proclaimed and designated on February 16, 1999, through executive order OE-199-10. This proclamation was made thanks to the effort and interest from local residents, the municipal administrations of Ciales and Jayuya, and the Guardianes de la Montaña ecological group. Its purpose is to preserve the ecological integrity of the forest terrains from urban development.[1]\\nThe forest is found along two river basins: the Arecibo and Manatí Rivers, both flowing northward into the Atlantic Ocean. Other rivers found within the forest boundaries are the Cialitos, Saliente, and Toro Negro rivers. The forest is particularly vital for the hydrological preservation of the Toro Negro River. The most notable geographical feature of the forest reserve is the Tres Picachos mountain, which rises to an elevation of 3,176 feet (968 m) above sea level. Tres Picachos literally translates to \"three little peaks,\" and it is named as such after the three distinctive peaks found at the summit of the mountain."

It features three main concert and theater halls for plays, ballet, operas, and concerts. It was renamed in 1994 after the late Puerto Rican philanthropist, politician, and Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis A. Ferré.\n\nThe Center opened on April 9, 1981, under the administration of Governor Carlos Romero Barceló after ten years of planning, project financing, and construction. Since then, it has become the most important performing arts venue in the Puerto Rican capital, presenting the highest level of commercial theater in Puerto Rico along with ballets and operas, and also hosting artists such as Plácido Domingo and Menudo. The center is home to the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra and the annual Casals Festival.\n\nIn January 2019, Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical Hamilton began its third touring production at the venue, with Miranda reprising the title role of Founding Father and Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, with higher praise than his original run on Broadway. Miranda returned to the venue after nine years since he reprised the role of Usnavi exclusively in San Juan during the North American touring production of In the Heights, which he also wrote."

Hildebrand of the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce.[3] The original district consisted of six buildings and additional infrastructure built using stone and concrete as construction materials. The hatchery facilities officially opened in January 1938, and it represents the introduction of recreational fishing or sport fishing in Puerto Rico.[2]\n\nThe Government of Puerto Rico added an additional 2.75 acres for the hatchery in 1940, and by 1942, the expanded fish hatchery facilities included large grow-out ponds for breeding fish (particularly brown and rainbow trout) and sixteen smaller ponds for breeding crustaceans. At a later date, another grow-out pond was added in the northern segment, west of the original ponds. Reconstruction of these facilities was undertaken between the years 1998 and 2000 after considerable damages caused by Hurricane Georges, which devastated the island in September 1998.[4] At a later date, a visitor parking lot was built on a lot across the Maricao River. This visitors parking is not included within the district's boundaries.[1][2]"

Later, a wooden bridge was built on top of the causeway, which was in turn replaced by a brick edification in 1784. This bridge, designed by Juan Francisco Mestre, was destroyed by the British during Ralph Abercromby's invasion of Puerto Rico. After this, the bridge was rebuilt in 1846 with a design by engineer Santiago Cortijo. This new bridge measured 220 feet long and 6 meters wide, and was composed of nine elliptical arches.[2]"

These rocks form a natural shallow pool with calm waters that is perfect for families and children. Larger waves do occasionally reach this shallow pool during stormy weather, leaving tide pools behind. The western side of the beach is located away from the limestone rocks and, while considered more dangerous, it can be ideal for surfing.[3]\n\nThe beach has recreational facilities such as picnic tables, bathrooms, showers, playgrounds, and food kiosks. There are active guards on duty during daylight hours. The balneario and the water quality on the beach are also monitored by the Board of Environmental Quality (Spanish: Junta de Calidad Ambiental), and since 2018 it has been designated as a Blue Flag beach.[3]"

Its main entrance consists of a portico and a tower with a clock.[1] Its façade is of the neoclassical style, classified as such because of the building's Corinthian capitals and its Greco-Roman columns.[1] The architects were Carmoega and Ing. Font Jiménez; it was built by Ignacio Flores Lorenzo, and Adriano González was the contractor of the work.[1] The mayor that ordered the new city hall was Juan Rullán Rivera.[3] Numerous parlors, rooms, offices, and other services are situated in the building.[1]\\n\\n"

The neighborhood has many historic Spanish Revival-style homes with patios and gardens, and it was listed on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2007 for its historical and architectural value.[3]  \nThe neighborhood is under the legal jurisdiction of Santurce in the municipality of San Juan, Puerto Rico.[4]  \nIt first appears in the 16th century as a spring that fed water to the Spanish outpost of Old San Juan. During the Battle of San Juan (17 April – 2 May 1797), the town of Miramar was the site of the British ill-fated assault on the Spanish colonial port city of San Juan de Puerto Rico during the 1796–1808 Anglo-Spanish War.  \nIn the 17th century, a wide public street, the Central Highway (today Ponce de León Avenue), was built that ran through the spring. Commerce flourished since goods that arrived at the port of San Juan had to pass Miramar on their way to the rest of the island. Today, two sets of bridges known as San Antonio and Dos Hermanos connect the adjoining areas of Old San Juan and Condado. Its land area measures 0.24 sq. miles (0.62 km²), and it has a resident population of 5,440 according to the 2000 United States Census."

The design of the chapel was made by Czech architect Antonin Nechodoma, who lived in Puerto Rico. The chapel was finally opened in 1908.  \nInitially, the chapel was used by a Methodist Episcopal church. After that, it was occupied by the Union Church. Owners Pedro Santiago and Catalina Mejía de Santiago gave the building as a gift to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan de Puerto Rico on February 17, 1959."

            "Nuevo Milenio State Forest (Spanish: Bosque Estatal del Nuevo Milenio or Bosque Urbano del Nuevo Milenio) is one of the 20 forests that make up the public forest system of Puerto Rico. The forest is located east of the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden in the Sabana Llana Sur district of San Juan,[1] making it one of the two state forests located within the capital's municipal boundaries (the other being San Patricio State Forest).[2]\n\nThe area where the forest now stands had originally been deforested and was the site of several quarries. The forest reserve was first proclaimed in 1998 with the intention of preserving one of the last green areas in San Juan as a secondary forest. The city is very densely populated and has lost most of its forests due to urban sprawl. This was done thanks to the efforts of local residents, academics, and environmentalists. In 2003, the forest was added to the San Juan Ecological Corridor management zone, also managed by the municipality of San Juan, which designates the area as ecologically important as it forms part of the hydrological basin of the estuary of San Juan Bay.[2] Between the years 1998 and 2005, the forest was used for research purposes for studying the impact of Hurricane Georges on the destruction and regrowth of the forest.[3]\n\nThe forest is very characteristic of the secondary forest ecosystem found throughout Puerto Rico. Some native tree species found in the forest are the yarumo (Cecropia schreberiana), the West Indian locust tree (Hymenaea courbaril), the Puerto Rican royal palm tree (Roystonea borinquena), and the pink trumpet tree (Tabebuia heterophylla) or Puerto Rican oak as it is colloquially known. Common introduced trees found in the forest are the flea tree (Albizia lebbeck), the koa tree (Albizia procera), and the Malay pterocarpus (Pterocarpus indicus).[2]"

It is by the Piedras River, next to the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden. This aqueduct dates to the mid-19th century and it was important for the urban development of Río Piedras.[2][3]\n\nThe development of an aqueduct at the site by the Piedras River dates to 1825 and it was important to the urban development of Río Piedras, then known as El Roble. The waterworks were critical for their supply of clean water which was fundamental to the city's growth along a main corridor that still exists as Ponce de León Avenue. The original design of the existing aqueduct structure dates to 1847 and was designed by engineer Juan Manuel Lomber. The waterworks went through many upgrades since then done by American and British engineers that were completed by the time of the Spanish-American War of 1898, with some main components installed some years later, between 1917 and 1918.[2][4]\n\nThe Puerto Rico Conservation Trust (Para la Naturaleza) currently manages 9 out of the 23 acres of the historic site, and since 2007 has been working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to preserve the site. The nonprofit organization proclaimed the historic district a National Treasure in 2014.[2][5] Current plans for the district include the restoration of the site's facilities for use as a visitor center dedicated to research, recreation, and education about the benefits of water resource conservation.[6]"

            "Paseo de la Princesa (English: Promenade of the Princess or Princess Promenade), is a partially waterside 19th-century pedestrian promenade about 0.50 miles (0.80 km) in length, located in the historic district of Old San Juan in Puerto Rico. Constructed between 1852 and 1854 in honor of Queen Isabella II of Spain's first-born, Princess of Asturias Infanta Isabel, the promenade runs adjacent and parallel to the southwestern section of the Walls of Old San Juan.[1][2] Lined with Victorian lampposts and benches, large trees and gardens, and varying fountains and sculptures, it hosts food and artisan vendors, musical and theatrical entertainers, and cultural restaurants and festivals.[3]\n\nThe promenade starts at Bastión de la Derecha de San Justo y Pastor on the Walls of Old San Juan in Marina, the southernmost sub-barrio in Old San Juan on the San Juan Islet, passing by the Antigua Prisión La Princesa (Old La Princesa Prison) from 1837, currently housing the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, and the popular Fuente Raíces (Roots Fountain), a large sculptural fountain overlooking San Juan Bay since 1992 that represents Puerto Rican identity, a mixture of Taíno, Spanish, and Sub-Saharan African ancestry and culture, and ending in the southwestern sub-barrio of Catedral in Old San Juan at the beginning of the western section of the Walls of Old San Juan at Puerta de San Juan (San Juan Gate), formerly known as Puerta de Agua (meaning 'water gate'), which lies next to La Fortaleza, the 16th-century executive residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico, and is the starting location of Paseo del Morro (Morro Promenade), the waterfront promenade covering the rest of the western section of the defensive walls, culminating on Punta del Morro (Morro Point) at the bottom of Castillo San Felipe del Morro at the westernmost position on San Juan Islet overlooking the entrance to San Juan Bay.[4][1][2]\n\nPaseo de la Princesa is often described as one of the most scenic city walkways in the world and, as a result of its location close to the cruise ship harbor, it is often the starting point for sightseeing in Old San Juan.[5]"

            "Plaza Colón is the main plaza in the city of Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. This plaza and its fountain commemorate the explorer Christopher Columbus, whose name in Spanish was Cristóbal Colón.[3] The plaza presents the traditional urban relationship in Puerto Rico with the church, now Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria Cathedral, on one end of the plaza and the \"Alcaldía\" or Mayagüez town hall on the other. Its location was designated in 1760 close to the city founding.[4]  \nThe plaza is paved in marble and is graced by a group of lampposts in bronze that date back more than one hundred years. Each lamp is held by an oriental odalisque, including characteristic clothes, turbans, and veils.[5] The plaza was designed after the Great Fire of 1841, approximately in 1842; years later, after being paved, the plaza had a fountain in the center.[6] The plaza has been remodeled several times, including when Benjamin Cole was mayor and under the current mayor José Guillermo Rodríguez.  \nFollowing the theory that Columbus disembarked in Mayagüez; in 1896, a statue of the Admiral was placed in the main plaza in the city, thus it came to be known as Plaza Colón.[7] The statue was made by A. Coll y P in Barcelona in 1843.[8][9]"

            "The Polvorín de Miraflores is an 18th-century structure in San Juan, Puerto Rico, specifically in the Isla Grande (Big Island) sector of Santurce, that served as an ammunition storage place for the Spanish military. The site was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000 for its historic importance.[2]\\nThe Polvorín was built on orders of Field Marshal Alejandro O'Reilly, who visited the island in 1765 to gauge the status of the island defenses on a request of King Charles III. Among O'Reilly's recommendations was the construction of five ammunition storage (or polvorín) to support the other artillery structures on the island. Some accounts state the specific construction date as 1770[3] and others as 1776.[4]\\nWhen the Spanish-American War ended in 1898, the United States took control of the island. From that time until the 1930s, the Polvorín de Miraflores was used as a quarantine station under the administration of the United States Public Health Service. Ship passengers and immigrants were inspected here and, if necessary, were isolated from the population."

            "The Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico) is a private Roman Catholic university with its main campus in Ponce, Puerto Rico. It provides courses leading to Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate degrees in education, business administration, the sciences, and arts and humanities. It also has campuses in Arecibo and Mayagüez, as well as a satellite extension in Coamo. It is also home to a School of Law and a School of Architecture. The university also founded a medical school, Escuela de Medicina de Ponce, in 1977, but in 1980 it became an independent entity that eventually became the Ponce Health Sciences University.\n\nThe Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico was founded in 1948 as Universidad Católica de Santa María, but its name was changed to Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico with the graduation of its first class in 1950. On 25 January 1991, the name was changed again to its current name, after Pope John Paul II bestowed the title of pontifical on the university."

            "Río Abajo State Forest is a forest preserve in Puerto Rico owned by the Department of Natural Resources and one of the 20 state forests on the island. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1980 and constitutes an area of 3,590 acres. It consists mostly of subtropical wet and moist karst forest. Mogotes and sinkholes fill the landscape.[1][2] The forest preserve is located in the municipalities of Arecibo and Utuado. In addition to its ecological value, the forest also contains a number of archaeological sites.[3]\n\nMuch of the development within the forest area was made by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) during the 20th century. The forest preserve was one of the five designated forests established in 1943 by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (Spanish: Administración de Reconstrucción de Puerto Rico) to preserve the remaining forested areas on the island. This forest also protects a large portion of the Arecibo River hydrological basin.[3] The remains of the lumber roads cut by the loggers and CCC workers have now become trails.[4] Due to its value as an ideal representation of the karstic ecosystems in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, the state forest was designated a National Natural Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior in 1980.[5]\n\nRío Abajo State Forest is located on rugged karstic terrain in north-central Puerto Rico, between the municipalities of Arecibo (Hato Viejo and Río Arriba) and Utuado (Caguana and Río Abajo)."

The church, one of the oldest in San Juan, is famous for its pink color, simple yet elegant interior design, and its arches. According to historian María de los Ángeles Castro, the church might have been decorated with frescoes created by renowned 18th-century artist José Campeche.[2] The church is open to visitors and still hosts religious services.  \n18°27′52″N 66°06′56″W / 18.46444°N 66.11556°W / 18.46444; -66.11556"

Maxx, Capri, Walgreens, PetSmart, Caribbean Cinemas, and Office Depot, plus an outdoor shopping area known as \"Liberty Square.\"  \n\nDuring the Spanish Colonial period, Tomás O'Daly was granted land in the vicinity of Guaynabo and O'Daly developed it into a thriving sugar hacienda. O'Daly and fellow Irishman Miguel Kirwan became business partners in the \"Hacienda San Patricio,\" which they named after the chief patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick. The plantation no longer exists. The land on which it was located is now a suburb called San Patricio with a shopping mall, San Patricio Plaza.[3]"

            "Distrito T-Mobile (initially developed as District Live!) is an entertainment and retail district complex located adjacent to the Puerto Rico Convention Center, part of a redevelopment of the Convention Center area that initially opened in 2005. Distrito T-Mobile is a 476,000 square foot complex of entertainment, dining, and shopping. It has 10 eateries, an 8-screen movie theater featuring IMAX, a 177-room hotel, 2 live music venues, an outdoor performance plaza, and an urban park featuring a zip line and a maze.\n\nInitially known as District Live!, Distrito T-Mobile is part of the planned Puerto Rico Convention Center District (master planned by Sasaki Associates). The main project was the Aloft hotel with 177 rooms, and a music hall which can seat 6,000 visitors, as well as a Caribbean Cinemas movie theater. [1] The Puerto Rican government selected Starwood, under its Sheraton flag, to operate the reported $209 million facility, known as the Sheraton Puerto Rico Hotel & Casino. [2] With these two hotels and others in the area, the district now has 1,762 hotel rooms available for visitors. [3]\n\nThe District came as part of a plan by the Puerto Rican Government to develop the areas surrounding the Puerto Rico Convention Center and add more tourist attractions that can bring visitors regularly to the area. The original plan was announced in 2016 by then governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla who hailed it as a public-private partnership where the government would give access to the land but the development of the facilities would fall completely on private hands, while the Puerto Rican Government kept a 30% share in the project. Construction began that very same year with an expected opening date of 2019. [4][5][6]"

Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.[7][8]\\nThe central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) (Spanish: a propósito para las fiestas), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (Spanish: grandeza proporcionada al número de vecinos). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.[7]\\n"

It is one of the oldest and largest educational institutions in Puerto Rico with origins dating back to the 1880 establishment of an elementary school by the Society of the Sacred Heart.\\nThe university is situated in an area which was urbanized in the first decades of the twentieth century with grand residences that belonged to the privileged families of the time and is rich in architectural styles. Renowned architect Antonín Nechodoma located his residence in Monteflores and some residences designed by him are still in the area. Including buildings with the unique French-style neoclassical architectural characteristics of the residence of Pablo Ubarri, Count of Santurce, which is now the center of the university's main campus. Such buildings abound along with Puerto Rican adaptations of Victorian architecture. There are also homes in the \"tropical\" U.S. influenced Mission Revival, French-Gothic, Spanish Colonial Revival, Prairie School, and several apartment structures of the \"Art Deco\" periods on Bouret Street.[3]\\nIt was the year 1880 when three nuns of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus landed on the docks of San Juan, coming from Havana, Cuba. Their mission was to establish in Puerto Rico the educational and spiritual work that just 80 years before Mother Madeleine Sophie Barat had begun in France."

            "The University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, School of Medicine is located in the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It's the only medical school in the University of Puerto Rico System. It is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Its students are predominantly Puerto Rican residents. However, anyone is allowed to apply to this university. It is also considered the top bilingual medical school in the world due to its requirement for each admitted student to fully master both English and Spanish.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, major health problems affected the Puerto Rican population. Anemia, malnutrition, and parasitism were some of the most common conditions in children and adults. With the arrival of U.S. troops in 1898, the need for effective health plans to serve the population became a priority. With the change of sovereignty, anaemia commissions were established in Puerto Rico. Thus began the development of what would become the Institute of Tropical Medicine, which was formalized in 1912.\n\nA consolidation of the former Institute of Tropical Medicine and other entities led in 1926 to the formation of the School of Tropical Medicine. Funds from Columbia University were used for the training of different health professionals on the island. At the same time, the school's professors conducted studies in collaboration with Columbia University physicians on tropical diseases hitherto of unknown etiology, or of high prevalence morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. In 1946, following the end of World War II, Columbia University canceled the money sent to the Medical School, which led to its closure. The legislature authorized a School of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico, into which the School of Tropical Medicine was integrated."

            "Villalba barrio-pueblo is a barrio and the administrative center (seat) of Villalba, a municipality of Puerto Rico. Its population in 2010 was 729.[1][4][5][6]\\nAs was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year.[7][8]\\nThe central plaza in Villalba barrio-pueblo is named Plaza de Recreo José Ramón Figueroa, after one of the town founders.[14] The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \"the parties\" (celebrations, festivities) (Spanish: a propósito para las fiestas), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (Spanish: grandeza proporcionada al número de vecinos). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.[7]"
